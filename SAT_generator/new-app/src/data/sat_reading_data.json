    "question": "Artist Marilyn Dingle's intricate, coiled baskets are ______ sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Following a Gullah technique that originated in West Africa, Dingle skillfully winds a thin palm frond around a bunch of sweetgrass with the help of a \"sewing bone\" to create the basket's signature look that no factory can reproduce. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "a": "indicated by",
    "b": "handmade from",
    "c": "represented by",
    "d": "collected with",
    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Marilyn Dingle's baskets. In this context, to say that Dingle's baskets are \"handmade from\" particular plants means that Dingle creates baskets herself using those plants but without using machines. The text says that Dingle \"skillfully winds\" parts of palmetto palm plants around sweetgrass plants to make baskets with an appearance that \"no factory can reproduce.\" This context suggests that Dingle's baskets are handmade from sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Dingle uses sweetgrass and palmetto palm to create her baskets, not how her baskets are \"indicated by,\" or signified by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Choice C is incorrect. Although Dingle's baskets are described as being made using sweetgrass and palm, there's nothing in the text to suggest that the baskets are \"represented by,\" or exemplified or portrayed by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Instead, the focus of the text is on Dingle's use of sweetgrass and palmetto palm and the impossibility of replicating the appearance of her baskets using machines. Choice D is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that Dingle's baskets are \"collected with,\" or brought together in a group with, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Instead, the text describes how Dingle uses those plants to make her baskets",

    "question": "The invention in 1958 of the integrated circuit (or microchip) radically altered the semiconductor industry. In fact, some historians argue that it fundamentally ______ the industry by enabling it to take advantage of mass production methods for the first time. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "a": "overwhelmed",
    "b": "bypassed",
    "c": "obstructed",
    "d": "transformed",
    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the invention of the integrated circuit. As used in this context, \"transformed\" means substantially changed in some way. The text states that the invention radically altered the semiconductor industry, with some historians claiming that it had a fundamental effect on the industry by allowing for mass production for the first time. This context conveys that the invention of the integrated circuit transformed the semiconductor industry. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the invention of the integrated circuit significantly affected (\"radically altered\") the semiconductor industry, it doesn't indicate that the invention \"overwhelmed\" the industry, which in this context would mean that it overcame the industry such that the industry struggled or was defeated. Instead, the text conveys that the invention's effect was positive, since it allowed the semiconductor industry to begin making use of mass production methods. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to say that the invention of the integrated circuit \"bypassed\" the semiconductor industry, which would mean it intentionally avoided the industry. The text indicates that the invention directly affected the semiconductor industry, since it made it possible for the industry to begin engaging in mass production methods. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate that the invention of the integrated circuit \"obstructed\" the semiconductor industry, which would mean that it blocked or hindered the industry in some way. Instead, the text indicates that the invention's effect was positive, since it made it possible for the semiconductor industry to begin engaging in mass production methods",

The alterations maples may undergo in response to a changing climate are likely to be relatively small and easily achieved. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "a": "relocate from",
    "b": "refer to",

    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of how maple trees may respond to changes in climate. As used in this context, \"adapt to\" means to adjust to new conditions. The text first notes that maple trees already thrive in a wide variety of climates and then goes on to say that alterations maples may undergo are likely to be relatively small and easily achieved. This context supports the idea that maple trees will more easily adjust or adapt to a changing climate. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses how maple trees adjust to change, the trees do not \"relocate from,\" or physically move from one place to another. Choice B is incorrect because \"refer to\" means to mention or allude to something, and the trees are not doing either of these actions. Choice C is incorrect because the text is discussing how maple trees may respond to changes in climate, not where they \"originate from,\" or came from originally",

    "question": "The following text is adapted from Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1837 story \"Dr. Heidegger's Experiment.\" The main character, a physician, is experimenting with rehydrating a dried flower. At first [the rose] lay lightly on the surface of the fluid, appearing to imbibe none of its moisture. Soon, however, a singular change began to be visible. The crushed and dried petals stirred and assumed a deepening tinge of crimson, as if the flower were reviving from a deathlike slumber. As used in the text, what does the phrase \"a singular\" most nearly mean?",
    "a": "A lonely",
    "b": "A disagreeable",
    "c": "An acceptable",
    "d": "An extraordinary",
    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, \"singular\" most nearly means extraordinary. The text portrays an experiment in which a character rehydrates a dried rose by infusing it with moisture. After prolonged contact with the liquid, the rose begins to absorb it, undergoing an exceptional transformation: its color deepens, its previously \"crushed and dried\" petals shift, and the entire flower revives \"from a deathlike slumber.\" In other words, an extraordinary change is visible in the flower. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts \"singular\" can mean of or relating to an individual or to a single instance of something, this usage doesn't imply loneliness or an otherwise unsatisfactory condition of isolation. Moreover, the text doesn't attribute such a condition to the rose. Choice B is incorrect. Although \"singular\" has several related meanings, none of them relate to being disagreeable or unpleasant. Moreover, the text doesn't portray the change undergone by the rose as necessarily disagreeable. Choice C is incorrect because \"singular\" means extraordinary, not acceptable. The change is portrayed as striking, not barely satisfactory",

    "question": "Rejecting the premise that the literary magazine Ebony and Topaz (1927) should present a unified vision of Black American identity, editor Charles S. Johnson fostered his contributors' diverse perspectives by promoting their authorial autonomy. Johnson's self-effacement diverged from the editorial stances of W.E.B. Du Bois and Alain Locke, whose decisions for their publications were more ______.

    "a": "proficient",

    "c": "ambiguous",
    "d": "unpretentious",
    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. A person who is \"dogmatic\" believes strongly that their principles and opinions are true. Because Du Bois and Locke are implied to have one \"unified vision\" of Black American identity that they prioritize over the \"diverse perspectives\" of different writers, they can be described as dogmatic. Choice A is incorrect. \"Proficient\" means \"skilled.\" Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson was not skilled at making editorial decisions. Based on the text, the three editors just have different styles; they're not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect. \"Ambiguous\" means \"unclear\" or \"open to multiple interpretations.\" However, it's actually Johnson who encouraged multiple interpretations (\"diverse perspectives\"). Since Du Bois and Locke are said to \"diverge\" from Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but instead clear and firm (a \"unified vision\"). Choice D is incorrect. \"Unpretentious\" means \"not trying to impress others with greater skill or importance than is actually possessed.\" Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson is pretentious (trying to impress others)",

    "a": "reduced",
    "b": "evaluated",
    "c": "determined",
    "d": "acquired",
    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of how the flow of information between two regions of the brain may affect the ease of people's decision making. In this context, \"reduced\" means decreased. The text presents the finding from a team of neuroeconomists that decision making may be connected to communication between the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex. In presenting this finding, the text suggests a contrast between people who tend to be more decisive and people who make decisions more slowly. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between the two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. On the other hand, this context suggests that people make choices more slowly when the flow of information between the two brain regions is decreased. Choice B is incorrect because \"evaluated\" means assessed, which wouldn't make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. This suggests that people's ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on an effort to assess the information. Choice C is incorrect because \"determined\" means judged or influenced, neither of which would make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. This suggests that people's ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on an effort to judge or influence the information.

    "question": "Some economic historians ______ that late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households in the United States experienced an economy of scale when it came to food purchases—they assumed that large households spent less on food per person than did small households. Economist Trevon Logan showed, however, that a close look at the available data disproves this supposition.

    "a": "surmised",
    "b": "contrived",
    "c": "questioned",
    "d": "regretted",
    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of late nineteenth- and early twentieth- century household food purchases. In this context, \"surmised\" means formed an idea or assumption with little evidence. The text explains that certain economic historians \"assumed\" that large and small households spent different amounts on food per person, but that another economist found this supposition to be false based on evidence from available data. This context suggests that the economic historians made an incorrect assumption without enough consideration of evidence. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, \"contrived\" would mean brought about or created through trickery. Nothing in the text suggests that the economic historians were deliberately trying to trick people with a claim about food purchasing behaviors in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households; the text simply suggests that they made an assumption about those behaviors that another historian believes isn't supported by the available data. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that it's Logan and not the economic historians who \"questioned,\" or doubted, the assumption that large and small households in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries spent different amounts on food per person; the economic historians are the ones who made that assumption to begin with. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some economic historians \"regretted,\" or felt sad or remorseful about, the food purchasing behaviors of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households. The text focuses on the idea that the economic historians made an assumption about those behaviors that may not be supported by available data, not on the historians' emotional response to what households did in the past",

The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness. As used in the text, what does the word \"disturbed\" most nearly mean?",
    "a": "Disorganized",
    "b": "Alarmed",
    "c": "Offended",
    "d": "Interrupted",
    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, \"disturbed\" most nearly means alarmed. The text portrays the narrator traveling in a carriage as wolves howl in the surrounding darkness. The text contrasts the reaction of both the narrator and the horses pulling the carriage with that of the driver of the carriage: the narrator and horses are \"dreadfully afraid,\" but the driver is \"not in the least disturbed.\" In other words, the driver is not alarmed by the wolves nearby. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disturbed\" can mean disorganized, the text doesn't portray a character acting in a disorganized manner; instead, the driver continues to drive the carriage, even though the horses pulling it are alarmed. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disturbed\" can mean offended, the text doesn't portray one character feeling offended, or upset, by another's actions; instead, it contrasts the fear felt by the narrator with another character's lack of fear. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disturbed\" can mean interrupted, the text doesn't portray an action being interrupted; indeed, the travel depicted in the scene continues despite the threat of the wolves outside the carriage",

    "a": "prolong",
    "b": "rectify",
    "c": "retain",
    "d": "highlight",
    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of how Maggie Lena Walker addressed the lack of financial services available to Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, at the turn of the twentieth century. In this context, \"rectify\" means to correct or remedy something undesirable. The text indicates that by chartering the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank in 1903, Walker took action to provide local Black residents with greater access to financial services like home loans and savings opportunities. This context supports the idea that she aimed to rectify the undesirable situation affecting these residents. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, \"prolong\" would mean to lengthen something in time. The text indicates that at the turn of the twentieth century, Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, were faced with a lack of formal banking options. The text then states that Walker founded a new bank that provided these residents with financial services. Therefore, instead of prolonging the situation, she took steps to rectify, or correct, it. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"retain\" would mean to continue to have or to keep something. According to the text, at the turn of the twentieth century, Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, had few formal banking options, and Walker chartered a new institution to provide these residents with expanded financial services; therefore, she took steps to rectify, not retain, the situation. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"highlight\" would mean to emphasize or call attention to something, but the text indicates that Walker took concrete steps beyond merely drawing attention to the situation Black residents were facing in Richmond, Virginia, at the turn of the twentieth century. According to the text, Walker worked to rectify, or correct, the lack of formal banking options that were available to these residents by establishing a bank that provided them with home loans and savings opportunities",

    "a": "waive",

    "d": "require",
    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the significance of the 2014 archaeological finding at El Algar. In this context, \"concede\" means to admit something is true after first resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe \"Bronze Age societies were ruled by men.\" But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included \"valuable objects signaling a high position of power,\" which would raise the possibility that \"women may have also held leadership roles.\" Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion. Choice A is incorrect because \"waive\" means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be observed; the word isn't used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid, as is the case in the text. Choice C is incorrect. According to the text, the finding from the El Algar burial site undermines the view that Bronze Age societies were exclusively ruled by men. However, \"refute\" means to demonstrate that something is false and would not make sense in context. Lull and team's finding supports the view that women may have also held leadership roles, not that they did not participate in such roles. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"require\" means to demand or specify as mandatory. However, it would not make sense for contemporary researchers to demand that Bronze Age \"women may have also held leadership roles.\"",

    "a": "invented",
    "b": "adjusted",

    "d": "recommended",
    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Ester Hernandez's art. In this context, \"featured\" means shown prominently. The text focuses on where Hernandez's works have been and continue to be displayed, explaining that her early works, which consisted of murals, could be viewed in outdoor spaces in San Francisco. The central contrast developed in the text is between where her early works could be viewed and where her works can be viewed now, which is in museums across the United States and around the world. The context therefore supports the idea that Hernandez's works are now shown, or featured, in museums globally. Choice A is incorrect because in this context \"invented\" would mean created something for the first time, which isn't supported since the text doesn't discuss where Hernandez creates her works or whether they're original or innovative. Choice B is incorrect because \"adjusted\" in this context would mean adapted. Although the text mentions that many of Hernandez's early works were outdoor murals and thus it may be reasonable to infer that Hernandez altered her approach to creating art so that her works could be displayed in indoor venues instead, the text makes no mention of how Hernandez's works might have been adapted for such venues. The text focuses on where Hernandez's works have been and continue to be displayed, not on how she or anyone else may have adapted, or adjusted, her works. Choice D is incorrect because \"recommended\" in this context would mean endorsed or put forth as a suggestion for something that is worth seeing. Although it may be reasonable to say that in choosing to display certain works, museum curators believe such works are worth seeing, the text doesn't discuss the reasons why museums display Hernandez's works. Instead, the text mainly develops a contrast between where Hernandez's early works could once be viewed and where her work can be viewed now",

According to the text, conservationists planted more than 500,000 native trees in an Azores bullfinch habitat in order to boost the bird's population size. The text then indicates that the population size did indeed grow as a result of the planted trees.

Choice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the conservationists' approach of planting native trees to increase Azores bullfinch's numbers was \"amusing,\" or comical or entertaining. Instead, the approach was seriously undertaken and ultimately accomplished. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn't address how much it cost to achieve the goal of planting native trees to increase Azores bullfinch's numbers. The text indicates that the approach was beneficial and successful rather than \"costly,\" or expensive or harmful. Choice D is incorrect. According to the text, the conservationists' approach of planting native trees to increase Azores bullfinch's numbers was beneficial and successful rather than \"disastrous,\" or damaging or unsuccessful",

    "a": "circumvent",
    "b": "corroborate",
    "c": "disseminate",
    "d": "implement",
    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of a relationship between the results of randomized clinical tests of how effective common medical interventions are and the conclusions practitioners reach about such interventions in real-world settings. In this context, \"corroborate\" means confirm or support with evidence. The text indicates that one possible explanation for the relationship being discussed is that practitioners may overlook confounding variables—that is, additional factors other than the medical interventions being investigated that affect the observed outcomes. This means that practitioners may assume that an outcome is the direct result of a medical intervention when it is actually the result of a combination of factors. Clinical trials take steps to rule out factors other than the one being studied, so if those extra factors are actually having an effect on real-world outcomes, the trials are likely to produce conclusions different from those practitioners reach in their real-world observations. In other words, clinical trials may fail to corroborate practitioners' conclusions. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could \"circumvent,\" or find a way around or bypass, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; it's possible that researchers conducting the trials might avoid engaging with practitioners' conclusions, but findings from a study can't choose to get around something. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could \"disseminate,\" or spread widely, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; the researchers conducting the trials might choose to draw attention to practitioners' conclusions, but findings from a study can't spread anything. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could \"implement,\" or put into effect, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; the researchers conducting the trials might consider practitioners' conclusions, but findings from a study can't put anything into effect",

The text states that Ochoa \"doesn't have a definite idea\" about when humans might need to live in other environments and characterizes Ochoa's prediction as a \"conjecture,\" or a conclusion presented without convincing evidence.

This context conveys not only that the measurements differed from predictions but also that the extent of the difference was very large. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that there was a very large difference between the predicted mass and the actual measured mass of the subatomic particle, it doesn't explain the cause of, or reason behind, that difference.

While working on her translation of a novel written in Odia (a language of India) into English, the narrator looks out her window at night to clear her mind.

I longed for sleep to obliterate them but it eluded me.

    "b": "Finishing",
    "c": "Advertising",
    "d": "Rejecting",
    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, \"completing\" most nearly means finishing. In the text, the narrator conveys that the task of translating a novel has been an all-consuming one and that she hopes things will \"be normal again\" once she has \"sent off the manuscript.\" In other words, the narrator is looking forward to finishing her work on the manuscript and returning to other things. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, \"completing\" doesn't mean destroying, or ruining. The narrator addresses her desire to send off the manuscript she's focused on and her hope that things will be \"normal again\" once she does, conveying that she is looking forward to finishing the work, not to ruining it.

    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Theia and the origin of the Moon. In this context, \"notional\" means theoretical or only an idea. The text indicates that although something was once true of Theia, the protoplanet one theory holds collided with Earth and created debris that became the Moon, researchers now claim to have identified pieces of it deep in Earth's mantle. In other words, having direct evidence of Theia is a new development. This context suggests that before evidence was found, Theia was only theoretical—that is, that it was notional. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that Theia, a protoplanet, was \"desultory,\" which in this context would mean moving away from the matter at hand; indeed, the text focuses on the \"big whack\" theory of the origin of the Moon and indicates that Theia is a central part of that theory. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes the point that something was true of Theia until recently and suggests that this has changed now that researchers believe they have found pieces of the protoplanet deep in Earth's mantle. It wouldn't make sense to say that Theia was actually \"spurious,\" or false, until researchers found direct evidence of the protoplanet.

    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Renata Flores Rivera's use of Quechua in her music. In this context, \"inexperienced with\" means not accustomed to. The text indicates that Flores Rivera wanted to promote the Quechua language in her music and overcame a challenge by seeking help with pronunciation from her grandmother and by taking language classes. This context conveys the idea that Flores Rivera was not sufficiently familiar with Quechua to use it in her music without help. Thus, she was inexperienced with speaking the language, which she addressed by seeking help. Choice A is incorrect because describing Flores Rivera as \"prepared for\"—or ready for—speaking Quechua wouldn't make sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she were ready to speak the language, then there would be no challenge. Choice C is incorrect because describing Flores Rivera as \"skilled in\"—meaning good at or capable of—speaking Quechua wouldn't make sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she were capable of speaking the language, then there would be no challenge. Choice D is incorrect.

    "b": "irrelevant",

    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion about people's tendency to dismiss claims from sources perceived as self-interested, or acting for their own advantage. In this context, \"irrelevant\" means not applicable to the matter at hand. The text explains that as a matter of logical reasoning, the source of a claim has nothing to do with the claim's truthfulness—a claim is either true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates. This context suggests that even though people may distrust a claim based on its source, the source of the claim is actually irrelevant. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, \"indistinct\" would mean uncertain or not clearly recognizable. Instead of suggesting that the source of a claim can't be determined with certainty, the text suggests that recognizing a source and having an opinion of it simply doesn't matter because as a matter of logic, a claim is true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"indisputable\" would mean impossible to question or deny. Although the text suggests that it isn't logical to assume a claim is false just because its source appears to be self- interested, it doesn't go so far as to suggest that the source of a claim can't be questioned—the text instead makes the point that from a logical standpoint, the source of a claim doesn't matter because the claim is either true or false in and of itself. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"implicit\" would mean suggested or understood without being directly expressed. Nothing in the text suggests that logically, the source of a claim is only suggested; instead of addressing whether sources can be directly identified, the text focuses on the idea that sources don't matter because a claim is true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates",

    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Sterlin Harjo's approach to representing Native characters on television. As used in this context, \"repudiates\" means rejects or refuses to have anything to do with. The text indicates that television shows tend to depict Native characters as living long ago, but that Harjo's series Reservation Dogs focuses on Native teenagers in the present day, representing a \"rejection\" of the typical approach to depicting Native characters. This context thus indicates that Harjo repudiates television's general tendency regarding Native characters. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes Harjo's \"rejection\" of the typical approach to representing Native characters on television, so it wouldn't make sense to say that Harjo \"proclaims,\" or declares or affirms, television's general tendency regarding Native characters. Harjo is described as refusing to follow the pattern of depicting Native characters in the distant past, not as proclaiming that pattern. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes television's tendency to represent Native characters in the distant past as something that is already occurring, not as something that Harjo \"foretells,\" or predicts will happen in the future. The text is focused on Harjo's \"rejection\" of this pattern, not on any predictions he may have about it. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Harjo \"recants\" something would mean that he withdraws a previously held belief, and it wouldn't make sense to say that Harjo recants television's tendency to represent Native characters as living in the past. No beliefs previously held by Harjo are mentioned. Additionally, a tendency isn't a belief and thus isn't something that can be recanted",

    "b": "Discussed",
    "c": "Extended",
    "d": "Coated",

    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, \"spread\" most nearly means extended. The text states that the zoo is \"huge,\" that it covers \"numberless acres,\" and that it is large enough that a train is needed to explore it. Thus, the text's emphasis on the zoo's size suggests that the zoo extended, or stretched, over a large area of land. Choice A is incorrect because if the zoo covers \"numberless acres,\" then it could not reasonably be described as hidden, or concealed from view. Choice B is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the zoo was discussed, or talked about. Rather, the text focuses on the zoo's large size. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts \"spread\" can mean coated, it doesn't have that meaning in this context because to coat something means to apply a thin layer of a liquid substance, such as oil or paint, to a surface.

It wouldn't make sense to contrast struggling viburnum plants with those being damaged by insects, because in both cases the plants would be experiencing difficulties.

In this context, \"an exhaustive\" account would be a thorough one. The text states that much of the evidence from her reign was purposely destroyed—in other words, there is a lack of surviving records. This context conveys that unless there are major new archaeological discoveries, an exhaustive account of Hatshepsut's reign is unlikely. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, \"an imaginative\" account would be an account based on imagination, or ideas and speculation, rather than facts. The text indicates that much of the evidence of Hatshepsut's reign was deliberately destroyed, and a lack of evidence actually makes it more likely that accounts will be imaginative to some degree and not strictly factual. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"a superficial\" account would be one that is lacking in depth or concerned only with what is obvious. The text indicates that most evidence of Hatshepsut's reign was purposely destroyed, which suggests that accounts of that time are likely already somewhat superficial, since there is little information available to support deeper knowledge. Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be superficial. Choice D is incorrect because \"a questionable\" account would be one likely to be challenged or doubted, and since the text suggests that little evidence of Hatshepsut's reign has survived, accounts of that time probably involve some speculation and thus may already be open to doubt.

    "question": "Although science fiction was dominated mostly by white male authors when Octavia Butler, a Black woman, began writing, she did not view the genre as ______: Butler broke into the field with the publication of several short stories and her 1976 novel Patternmaster, and she later became the first science fiction writer to win a prestigious MacArthur Fellowship.

    "b": "impenetrable",
    "c": "compelling",
    "d": "indecipherable",
    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of Octavia Butler's career. In this context, \"impenetrable\" means impossible to enter. The text indicates that the field of science fiction was dominated by white males when Butler, a Black woman, started writing, but she published several science fiction short stories and a novel and later won a prestigious award; that is, Butler pursued science fiction writing and had success. This context suggests that Butler didn't view the genre as impossible to enter. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, \"legitimate\" would mean genuinely good or valid. Nothing in the text suggests that Butler didn't think the science fiction genre was good or valid; in fact, it indicates that she pursued and made a successful career of publishing work in that field. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"compelling\" would mean attracting or demanding attention. The text indicates that Butler chose to write science fiction, so it wouldn't make sense to say that she didn't see the field as drawing her attention. Choice D is incorrect. To say that Butler didn't consider science fiction \"indecipherable,\" or impossible to understand, would suggest that Butler did understand it. However, the text doesn't address Butler's ability to interpret works in the genre; rather, it focuses on Butler's successful pursuit of writing science fiction",

    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of noses on ancient sculptures. In this context, \"fragile\" means weak or delicate. This matches the text's description of noses on ancient sculptures, which are often missing from sculptures' heads because they are \"especially easy to break.\" Therefore, this context indicates that noses on ancient sculptures are the most fragile part of the sculptures' heads. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, \"recognizable\" would mean identifiable, and since the text indicates that noses are often missing from ancient statues, they therefore cannot be the most recognizable part of the statue. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that many ancient statues are missing noses, so noses wouldn't be \"common,\" or frequent, aspects of ancient statues; they would conversely be uncommon. Choice D is incorrect because the text only indicates that noses on ancient statues often stick out and end up missing from the heads, which doesn't relate to the noses being \"sophisticated,\" or knowledgeable or refined",

    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Ulysses Jenkins's video art. As used in this context, \"newfound\" means recently discovered or established. The text indicates that in the 1970s, video cameras became cheaper and therefore more widely available than they had been in the past. The text goes on to say that this development provided Jenkins and other artists with capabilities that they previously didn't have. As a result, Jenkins began producing groundbreaking works of video art. This context supports the idea that Jenkins took advantage of newfound access to video cameras. Choice B is incorrect because \"delicate\" means fine in texture or structure or easily broken, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text doesn't focus on describing what video art looks like or whether it's breakable. Choice C is incorrect because \"inevitable\" means impossible to avoid, which wouldn't make sense in this context. The text doesn't discuss the likelihood of artists, or anyone else, gaining access to video cameras. Choice D is incorrect because \"habitual\" means doing something regularly or repeatedly. Although the text does suggest that Jenkins created multiple pieces of video art, its focus is on the fact that video cameras had only just become widely available to artists in the 1970s. Jenkins's ability to take advantage of video cameras to make art was therefore newfound, not habitual, at the time",

    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of self-control in cuttlefish. In this context, \"competent\" means capable. The text describes a study in which cuttlefish demonstrated an ability to exercise restraint by waiting for a favorite treat instead of eating a meal that was already available to them. That is, by delaying gratification, the cuttlefish in the study demonstrated that they were capable of, or competent at, exercising self-control. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that in demonstrating self-control, cuttlefish are \"awkward,\" or lacking skill or grace. If anything, the text indicates that cuttlefish appear to be surprisingly skilled at exercising self-control. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"imaginative\" would mean creative, and there's nothing in the text to suggest that cuttlefish demonstrate creativity. Instead, the text focuses on the fact that cuttlefish seem to be capable of exercising restraint and self-control. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"manageable\" would mean capable of being controlled. Although the text indicates that the cuttlefish in the study demonstrated restraint by waiting for a favorite treat instead of devouring a readily available meal (which suggests their ability to control themselves), it doesn't suggest that cuttlefish are thus also able to be managed or controlled by others",

    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Olga Tokarczuk's novel The Books of Jacob. As used in this context, \"complexity\" means having many complicated parts that when taken as a whole are difficult to follow or explain. The text indicates that The Books of Jacob has a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot (that is, a plot that is difficult to follow), and reverse page numbering. Together, these features make up a novel that's challenging to read and summarize. This context supports the idea that a brief book review can't do justice to the novel's complexity. Choice A is incorrect. Although the word \"accuracy,\" or being free from error or falsehood, can sometimes be used to describe a novel, the text doesn't discuss whether Tokarczuk's novel has this quality. Instead, the text describes the novel as having a large cast of characters, a difficult-to-follow plot, and reverse page numbering. These features suggest complexity, not accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because \"inactivity\" means being in a state of idleness or doing nothing, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text describes Tokarczuk's novel, and although it's possible the novel could portray its characters as inactive, it wouldn't make sense to describe the novel itself as such. Choice D is incorrect because in this context \"restraint\" would mean holding back or showing self-control, and the text doesn't indicate that Tokarczuk's novel has either of these qualities. In fact, the features of the novel that the text describes, such as a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot, and reverse page numbering, suggest excess and complexity, not restraint",

    "a": "Demanding",
    "b": "Signaling",
    "c": "Inviting",
    "d": "Shifting",
    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, \"beckoning\" most nearly means \"inviting,\" or attractive. The text portrays a woman who is looking at \"trees in their spring beauty.\" She compares them to cities, which have their own pleasures even if they do not have the \"easy unhuman loveliness\" of trees: she thinks of cities as \"seductive\" and \"charming,\" both adjectives that signify something that is enticing, or attractive. Therefore, cities that are seductive and charming would also be described as inviting people closer to them. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in this context that cities are \"demanding,\" or requiring effort. Choice B is incorrect. Though \"signaling,\" or communicating something, might be considered a key feature of the act of \"beckoning,\" in the context here, \"beckoning\" suggests that cities have attractive qualities that naturally draw people to them. Such attractive qualities are not described by the word \"signaling\" alone. Therefore, \"signaling\" is an incorrect answer because it is insufficiently precise. Choice D is incorrect because there is no reason to think in this context that the cities are \"shifting,\" or changing shape",

    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the creation of The Adventures of Prince Achmed. In this context, \"arduous\" means that the process is marked by great labor or effort. According to the text, the creation of the 1926 animated film The Adventures of Prince Achmed took three years and was a painstaking process. Since the process was so long and required great efforts by Lotte Reiniger and her team, the creation of the film was therefore an arduous process. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate that the creation of Reiniger's film was \"a haphazard,\" or disorganized, process. In fact, the text suggests that the creation process was quite meticulous and the team worked hard together to produce the envisioned effects. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does suggest that the creation of Reiniger's film was a long and difficult process, it doesn't suggest that the process was \"a contentious\" one, or one causing controversy or argument. The text suggests that the team worked together to produce the envisioned effects. Choice C is incorrect because rather than describing the process of creating the film as \"ineffectual,\" or not having the effect it was intended to have, the text describes the process as ultimately successful despite the difficulty it involved",

In this context, \"widespread\" means widely accepted or practiced. The text indicates that because Sequoyah's script accurately represented the spoken sounds of the Cherokee language and was easy to learn, nearly all Cherokee people were able to read and write it soon after it was created.

The text states that the historians quickly dismissed the letters claimed to have been written by Lincoln and Rutledge as fraudulent; this suggests that rather than being unable to \"relate,\" or tell others about, the letters' authenticity, the historians were able to share what they'd decided about the letters. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to suggest that the historians couldn't \"accommodate,\" or give consideration to, the authenticity of the letters claimed to have been written by Lincoln and Rutledge; the text states that the historians decided that the letters were fraudulent, which indicates that they did consider whether the letters were authentic",

The text indicates that the mechanical plastic-recycling process affects the environment and causes \"the loss of material quality.\" The text contrasts that with Chazovachii's chemical plastic-recycling process, which is cleaner and produces a desirable product. The text's emphasis on the negative aspects of mechanical recycling suggests that it is inadequate in terms of environmental impact and the quality of the material the process yields.

In this context, \"patterns\" means distinct and predictable sequences. The text indicates that although the flashes that fireflies produce appear to occur randomly—that is, without any particular sequence or rhythm—each species actually produces its own special series of flashes and pauses. Indeed, these series of flashes are so unique that fireflies can use them to find other members of their species. Therefore, this context supports the idea that fireflies produce flashes in distinct and recognizable patterns. Choice A is incorrect because \"quantities\" means certain amounts or numbers of something. Although the text discusses how different firefly species produce flashes and pauses in unique sequences that help other members of their species to find them, it doesn't mention the number of flashes that are used in these sequences. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"decorations\" would mean things that make an object more beautiful.

    "a": "overlooked",

    "d": "variable",
    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the sounds made by güiros. In this context, \"variable\" means able to change. The text begins by explaining that güiros are instruments made out of hollowed gourds with ridges cut into their sides and that players scrape the ridges with wooden sticks to produce sounds. The text goes on to say that güiros' sounds can change depending on gourd thickness, the distance between ridges, and the types of strokes the player uses, thus supporting the idea that the sounds created by these instruments are variable. Choice A is incorrect because \"overlooked\" means not being seen or noticed, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that the sounds produced by güiros are overlooked or not noticed. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"powerful\" would mean having a great ability to produce an effect. While it's possible that the sounds produced by güiros have a strong effect on listeners, the text doesn't discuss this aspect of their sounds. Choice C is incorrect because \"routine\" means usual and unvarying, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that the sounds produced by güiros are unvarying. In fact, the text describes how the sounds produced by güiros can differ based on several factors",

    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the challenge of generating electricity from ocean waves. In this context, \"consistent\" means steady or unchanging over time. The text introduces a challenge and then explains that wave power varies, or changes, unpredictably in ways that cause problems for electricity generation. This context conveys that the challenge being described is a lack of consistency. Choice A is incorrect because the text introduces a challenge and then elaborates on it by emphasizing that the unpredictable nature of variations in ocean waves causes problems, which doesn't indicate that wave power isn't \"accidental,\" or isn't happening unintentionally. It wouldn't make sense to describe waves—a natural occurrence—as happening intentionally. Choice B is incorrect because \"confident\" means having a feeling of self-assurance, and it wouldn't make sense to describe wave power itself in terms of either having or lacking a sense of confidence. Choice C is incorrect because the text introduces a challenge and then elaborates on it by emphasizing that the unpredictable nature of variations in ocean waves causes problems, which doesn't indicate that wave power isn't \"expensive,\" or isn't costly.

    "question": "The following text is from John Muir's 1913 autobiography The Story of My Boyhood and Youth. Muir describes being on a boat. The water was so clear that it was almost invisible, and when we floated slowly out over the plants and fishes, we seemed to be miraculously sustained in the air while exploring a veritable fairyland. As used in the text, what does the word \"clear\" most nearly mean?",
    "a": "Simple",
    "b": "Understandable",
    "c": "Obvious",
    "d": "Transparent",
    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, \"clear\" most nearly means transparent, or see-through. Muir states that the water beneath the boat \"was so clear that it was almost invisible,\" suggesting that those on the boat were able to see through the water and easily observe plants and fish below the surface. Choice A is incorrect. In some contexts \"clear\" can mean \"simple,\" or uncomplicated, but Muir is describing the water, and water isn't typically described as either simple or complicated. Muir emphasizes the water's transparency, not its simplicity. Choice B is incorrect. In some contexts \"clear\" can mean \"understandable,\" or reasonable or easily comprehended, but Muir is describing the water, and it doesn't make much sense to describe water as understandable. Muir emphasizes the water's transparency, not how easily the water can be understood. Choice C is incorrect. Although \"clear\" can mean \"obvious,\" or easily seen or understood, in some contexts, Muir's description emphasizes that the water \"was almost invisible\" and that the boat seemed to be \"sustained in the air,\" suggesting that the water was almost impossible to see, not that it was obvious",

    "a": "stymie",
    "b": "compound",

    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the consequences of raising the age at which retirees begin receiving government funds. The text indicates that raising the age for these funds is usually discussed in terms of effects on fund recipients but that Andria Smythe is instead considering the effects on working family members who care for retirees. Smythe notes that raising the age for the funds would increase the length of time retirees are dependent on financial assistance from working family members. This is suggested to have an effect on wealth creation for those workers, and most logically, that effect would be disadvantageous. Thus, \"stymie,\" which means to prevent or greatly hinder, is the most logical choice in context. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"compound\" would most nearly mean multiply or greatly enhance. The text indicates that raising the age at which retirees are eligible for government funds will increase the amount of time retirees are dependent on working family members for financial support. This would likely have a negative rather than a positive effect on wealth creation. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"disparage\" would most nearly mean criticize or defame. Nothing in the text suggests that raising the age at which retirees are eligible for government funds would defame wealth creation among working adults. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"outstrip\" would most nearly mean to exceed, and nothing in the text indicates that the financial support provided to retirees would exceed the amount of wealth these workers can create.

    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Ward and colleagues' findings.

The text describes the vibration and warming that Ward and colleagues used to alleviate itching as \"harmless applications\" and goes on to contrast these applications with another stimulus that actually offers more relief even though it seems to be stronger and \"less benign.\" This context conveys the idea that vibration and warming were innocuous stimuli. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a distinction between harmless stimuli and those that seem to be less benign. Nothing in the text suggests that any of the treatments are \"deceptive,\" or misleading; indeed, even the less effective ones are described as offering some relief. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on the amount of relief from itching offered by harmless stimuli and those that seem to be less benign.

    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of how Nia Imara facilitates the study of star formations. As used in this context \"intangible\" means unable to be physically handled or touched. The text states that star formations cannot be touched, and then goes on to explain that Imara created a special model to research star formations. In other words, despite the fact that real star formations are intangible, thanks to Imara, researchers can handle models of star formations to better understand them. Choice A is incorrect because \"repeatable\" means can be duplicated or done again, which wouldn't make sense in context. The text indicates that the swirls of gas and dust in which stars form are untouchable, but that Nia Imara has produced interactive models of them. It would therefore be illogical to suggest that Imara believes that the formations need not be duplicated and then go on to say that she has copied them. Choice B is incorrect because \"explicable\" means explainable or understandable, which wouldn't make sense in context. The text does not suggest that Nia Imara believes that star formations can be fully explained but rather that she produced interactive models to physically study them because researchers are unable to touch them directly. Choice C is incorrect because \"regrettable\" means distressing or unfortunate, which wouldn't make sense in context. The text does not suggest that Imara believes the researchers regret the star formations or find them distressing, but rather that she uses interactive models to physically study them",

As used in this context, \"persistent\" means existing continuously. The text states that Wauneka \"continuously worked to promote public health,\" traveling extensively and authoring a medical dictionary; this indicates that Wauneka's effort was persistent. Choice A is incorrect because describing Wauneka's effort related to public health as \"impartial,\" or not partial or biased and treating all things equally, wouldn't make sense in context. The text suggests that Wauneka's continuous work was partial in one way, as she focused specifically on promoting public health throughout the Navajo homeland and to speakers of the Navajo language. Choice B is incorrect because the text emphasizes that Wauneka's effort to promote public health as a Navajo Nation legislator was continuous and extensive, involving wide travels and the authoring of a medical dictionary. Because this work clearly involved care and dedication, it wouldn't make sense to describe it as \"offhand,\" or casual and informal. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Wauneka's effort to promote public health was \"mandatory,\" or required by law or rule, even though Wauneka was a Navajo Nation legislator.

Here they were now, in blue, disputing, every inch, our passage, with their wagons, handtrucks, their bursting baskets carried at an angle steeply self-confident on the back. ©1956 by James Baldwin As used in the text, what does the word \"disputing\" most nearly mean?",

The narrator is in a taxi as it drives down a street lined with so many food vendors and shoppers that the narrator describes them as \"the multitude of Paris,\" meaning an immense group of people. The street is essentially a large open-air market, and there are so many people pushing small wagons of goods and carrying shopping baskets that \"every inch\" of the taxi's progress is impeded. In other words, the people are providing resistance to the taxi's attempt to drive down the street. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean arguing, the narrator doesn't portray the shoppers and vendors as arguing with the driver of the taxi or, indeed, arguing at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean expressing disapproval, the narrator doesn't suggest that the shoppers and vendors necessarily disapprove of the taxi's attempt to drive down the street. Instead, their combined presence along the street has the effect of impeding the taxi's progress. Choice C is incorrect because, as the narrator explains, both the multitude of people and the taxi are using a public space (a street) at the same time.

As used in this context, \"interpret\" would mean decipher the meaning of. The text indicates that Ashbery's poems have many unusual features, that it's difficult to tell what exactly the poems' subject matter is, and that scholars strongly disagree about the poems. This context conveys the idea that it's difficult to interpret Ashbery's poems. Choice A is incorrect because \"delegate\" means to assign someone as a representative of another person or to entrust something to someone else, neither of which would make sense in context. The text is focused only on the difficulty that readers have interpreting Ashbery's poems due to their many unusual features; it doesn't suggest anything about the poems being difficult to delegate.

Choice D is incorrect because describing Ashbery's poems as being difficult to \"renounce,\" or give up or refuse, wouldn't make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that features of Ashbery's poems are odd or unclear and have caused heated scholarly debate. This context suggests that the poems are difficult to interpret, not that the poems are difficult to renounce",

Choice A is incorrect. \"Borrow\" means \"to take something with intent to return it.\" The text doesn't say anything about taking and returning the wilderness that surrounds the Appalachian Trail.

    "question": "While scholars believe many Mesoamerican cities influenced each other, direct evidence of such influence is difficult to ascertain. However, recent excavations in a sector of Tikal (Guatemala) unearthed a citadel that shows ______ Teotihuacán (Mexico) architecture—including a near replica of a famed Teotihuacán temple—providing tangible evidence of outside influence in portions of Tikal. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "a": "refinements of",
    "b": "precursors of",
    "c": "commonalities with",
    "d": "animosities toward",
    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of architectural influences among Mesoamerican cities. In this context, \"commonalities with\" means similarities to or shared attributes with. The text indicates that a recently discovered citadel in Tikal includes a close imitation of a famous temple in Teotihuacán (another Mesoamerican city) and other evidence of Teotihuacán influence, which suggests that the citadel possesses features that resemble architectural features found in Teotihuacán. This context thus indicates that the Tikal citadel shows commonalities with Teotihuacán architecture. Choice A is incorrect because there's nothing in the text that suggests that the Tikal citadel shows \"refinements of,\" or improvements on, Teotihuacán architecture. Although the text suggests that the architecture of Teotihuacán influenced the architecture of the Tikal citadel, and although it's possible that later architectural designs could make improvements on earlier designs, the text doesn't discuss whether, in imitating Teotihuacán architecture, the Tikal citadel's builders improved on it. Choice B is incorrect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showing \"precursors of\" Teotihuacán architecture—or features that preceded and foreshadowed those of Teotihuacán architecture—would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about the relationship between the architecture found in Tikal and Teotihuacán. The text claims that the discovery of similarities between the Tikal citadel and the architecture of Teotihuacán, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuacán, provides evidence of outside influences on Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was influenced by Teotihuacán architecture, then the Teotihuacán architecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around. In this context, therefore, it wouldn't make sense to say that the Tikal citadel shows precursors of Teotihuacán architecture. Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses how the citadel in Tikal indicates the influence of Teotihuacán architecture, which implies that the makers of the Tikal citadel likely admired aspects of Teotihuacán architecture enough to imitate it. Thus, there's no reason to think that the Tikal citadel provides evidence of the Tikal people's \"animosities toward,\" or feelings of strong dislike or hostility toward, Teotihuacán architecture",

From the sterile soil no ray Of hope in a blade of green, Nor sheltering roof is seen— Though the skies are heavy and gray. Ah, this is the woman fair Who stole away my heart In the splendid halls of art Yester-e'en as I wandered there! As used in the text, what does the word \"sheltering\" most nearly mean?",
    "a": "Protective",
    "b": "Restrictive",
    "c": "Affectionate",
    "d": "Suspicious",
    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \"sheltering\" most nearly means protective. In the text, the speaker describes a painting featuring a female figure. The speaker ultimately confesses to falling in love with the woman in the painting, who has \"stole[n] away\" the speaker's heart, but first the speaker describes elements of the painting's setting. These include sterile soil, barren fields with \"no ray / Of hope in a blade of green\"—a description that conveys a mood of melancholy and forlornness, possibly reflecting the speaker's own sadness at falling in love with an image that can't return the speaker's love. The text continues by stating that there's no \"sheltering roof\" in the painting, even though the \"skies are heavy and gray,\" showing signs of an impending storm. Generally, a roof's intended purpose is to provide protection from the elements, and in this context, a roof would offer shelter and protection from the gathering storm. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that a roof would be restrictive—that is, that it would limit or restrain something in some way. Although a roof would provide some cover from stormy winds and rain, it wouldn't limit the wind and rain, only deflect them. Choice C is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that if a \"sheltering roof\" were present in the painting, it would be affectionate, or loving and tender. In the text, the immediate context in which the word \"sheltering\" appears refers to the absence of a roof that would provide protection from the oncoming storm depicted in the painting, not to the idea that such a shelter would be loving and tender if it were present. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, suspicious would mean questionable or dubious, and there's nothing in the text to suggest that if any roofs were present in the painting, they would be questionable or cause any suspicion",

Mrs. Spring Fragrance was unaware that Mr. Spring Fragrance, tired with the day's business, had thrown himself down on the bamboo settee on the veranda, and that although his eyes were engaged in scanning the pages of the Chinese World, his ears could not help receiving the words which were borne to him through the open window. As used in the text, what does the word \"receiving\" most nearly mean?",
    "a": "Denying",
    "b": "Entering",
    "c": "Carrying",
    "d": "Hearing",
    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, \"receiving\" most nearly means hearing, or perceiving sound. The text describes Mr. Spring Fragrance as he reads a newspaper, focusing on his eyes and ears. While his eyes look at the newspaper, he is unwillingly distracted by words coming through a nearby open window (that is, \"his ears could not help receiving the words\"). The words are being perceived specifically by his ears and not his eyes, and ears are the organs of sense with which one hears, so therefore Mr. Spring Fragrance is hearing the words through the open window. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that Mr. Spring Fragrance is denying, or refusing the truth of, the words coming to him through the window. He is merely distracted by them. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that Mr. Spring Fragrance's ears couldn't help entering, or coming into, the words coming to him through the window. Instead, the text indicates that the opposite occurs: that is, when Mr. Spring Fragrance hears the words, they enter his ears, but his ears don't enter the words. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn't make sense in this context to think of Mr. Spring Fragrance as carrying the words coming to him through the window, even though the word \"carry\" can have a number of different meanings depending on context: for example, he is not lifting them, he is not supporting them, and he is not accepting blame for them (as one \"carries the blame\" for a mistake)",

    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of climate activity in Earth's distant past. In this context, to \"simulate\" most nearly means to represent a natural process using computer models. According to the text, understanding Earth's early climate is difficult because we cannot make direct observations of the distant past. Instead, scientists must create computer models that approximate early climate conditions, based on the physical evidence that those conditions left behind on Earth's surface. This context supports the idea that computer models simulate Earth's climate in the distant past. Choice A is incorrect because scientists use existing physical evidence as a basis for developing computer models that describe what Earth's actual past climate might have been like. The models are not being used to \"invent,\" or imagine, a completely fictional climate. Choice C is incorrect because the computer models are being used in an attempt to describe as accurately as possible what Earth's past climate might have been like.

    "a": "dominance",
    "b": "creativity",
    "c": "insignificance",
    "d": "neutrality",
    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text's discussion of the Southern Pacific Railroad. As used in this context, \"dominance\" means the state of being more successful than others. The text states that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California's railways in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the first transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Therefore, the Southern Pacific Railroad would be more successful than other railroads in the area, and the construction of the Sunset Route would further solidify its dominance in rail access to California's coast. Choice B is incorrect. Although the construction of the Sunset Route must have required some creativity, or use of imagination, the word \"creativity\" would not also encompass the fact that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California's railways. The text is more focused on the railroad's control of the field and overall success rather than its imaginative thought processes. Choice C is incorrect because if the Southern Pacific Railroad controlled the majority of California's railways, it would not make sense to refer to its \"insignificance,\" or the state of being unimportant. Rather, the opposite would be true. Choice D is incorrect because in context it would not make sense to refer to the Southern Pacific Railroad's \"neutrality,\" or absence of strong opinion on a matter, since no opinions are mentioned. Nor would \"neutrality\" in the sense of impartiality in a conflict be a logical or precise choice since no conflict is explicitly described. There might be an implied conflict between the Southern Pacific Railroad and other railroads doing business in California, but that is not a conflict in which the Southern Pacific Railroad would take an impartial position",

    "a": "Conclude",
    "b": "Dictate",
    "c": "Evaluate",
    "d": "Select",
    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text \"determine\" most nearly means \"dictate.\" The text describes the relationship between the main character and those who exhibit, praise, and purchase his artwork. The text states that the main character is often asked to change his art or himself based on outside influences, and he usually acquiesces. Because the main character admits that those who support his work often shape it based on their demands, it follows that those outside influences dictate, or guide or dominate, the direction his work takes. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that outside influences \"conclude,\" or end, the main character's work. The text states that many supporters of the main character's art \"demand its proliferation,\" not its conclusion. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that outside influences are \"evaluating,\" or judging the main character's work. According to the text, the main character's art has already achieved great commercial success, with many people exhibiting, purchasing, and praising his work. Thus, outsiders have already supported the main character's work and are not questioning or evaluating its success or worth. They are instead influencing its initial direction.

    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the research that Lopes-Ferreira and her colleagues are conducting on the stingray species Potamotrygon rex. As used in this context, \"a substantial\" effect means an effect that is sizable or noteworthy. The text indicates that the researchers are seeking to determine whether there are \"considerable variations\" in the potency of stingray venom that are associated with variation in the stingrays' age and sex. This context suggests that the researchers want to find out whether stingray age and sex have a substantial effect on venom toxicity. Choice A is incorrect because there's nothing in the text that suggests that the researchers have been studying whether the stingrays' age and sex have \"a disconcerting,\" or an unsettling and disturbing, effect on the stingrays' venom.

In this context, \"promote\" means play a part in the success or growth of something or someone. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes work to preserve culturally important sites. It goes on to say that their decision to create a national trail connecting the sites was motivated by the fact that such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn't otherwise receive. Thus, such a decision would promote the preservation efforts. Choice A is incorrect because \"inspire\" means motivate or influence, which wouldn't make sense in context. The text establishes that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally significant sites and that their decision to create a new national trail occurred as a result of a desire to add protections to the sites that they wouldn't otherwise receive. Thus, creating the trail wouldn't inspire the efforts to preserve the sites; instead, it would promote the efforts.

    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of visual balance in photography. In this context, \"contingent on\" means conditional upon, or determined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers (for example, symmetrical composition tends to emphasize similarity among elements, whereas asymmetry tends to emphasize difference). Thus, there is a strong connection between what a photograph conveys and how its elements are balanced. Therefore, what a photo conveys is contingent on how it is balanced. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, \"inhibited by\" most nearly means hindered or undermined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers, thereby indicating a relationship between image balance and what is conveyed. Although this explanation is consistent with a photographer choosing asymmetrical balance even while intending to convey similarity (associated with symmetrical balance), there is nothing to indicate that messages generally are inhibited by balance. Rather the implication is that balance is a tool photographers can use to craft their messages. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"obligated to\" means duty bound toward or answerable to. In context, it would not make sense to assert that a photograph's message is obligated to how that photograph is balanced. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"reserved for\" most nearly means solely available to someone or held aside for some purpose.

    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the twelfth-century Islamic philosopher Ibn Rushd. As used in this context, \"inconsequential to\" means not significant to. According to the text, Ibn Rushd's works were primarily available in Spain, where he lived, far from central areas of the Muslim world, a fact that could support the conclusion that his influence on Muslim contemporaries was limited. The text implies, however, that recent scholarship has shown that his works still had an impact on other Muslim philosophers of his time. This context supports the idea that his works weren't inconsequential to Islamic thought in this period. Choice A is incorrect because the issue under consideration in the text is whether other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd's time had access to his works, not whether his works were \"controversial among,\" or causing dispute among, other philosophers. Choice B is incorrect. The text implies that other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd's era were aware of his works, not that they were \"antagonistic toward,\" or hostile toward, them. There is no suggestion that Ibn Rushd's writings elicited hostility from his contemporaries. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"imitated by\" would mean followed as a model by. Although the text implies that Ibn Rushd's works were at least somewhat available in regions that were at the center of Islamic thought during the period, it doesn't specifically address in what ways his works influenced contemporary Muslim philosophers. Thus, the text doesn't support the idea that other philosophers modeled their own works after Ibn Rushd's works",

    "a": "disengage",
    "b": "annotate",
    "c": "buttress",
    "d": "reciprocate",
    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the legitimacy of the reigns of French monarchs such as Hugh Capet and Henry I. As used in this context, \"buttress\" means to strengthen or defend. The text indicates that regardless of whether a French monarch's reign was significant or uneventful, each monarch faced questions about his right to the throne. The text goes on to say that in order to understand the path of a French monarch's reign, it's important to understand what contributed to the monarch's ability to \"hold the throne.\" This context suggests that French monarchs such as Hugh Capet and Henry I had to buttress, or defend, their right to be monarch. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to \"disengage,\" or withdraw his right to the French throne. The text focuses on an examination of people who reigned as French monarchs, not on people who didn't choose to rule. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to \"annotate,\" or add notes to or explain, his right to the French throne. Nothing in the text suggests that the monarchs were writing notes about their right to the throne; instead, faced with questions about the legitimacy of their reign, the monarchs defended their right. Choice D is incorrect. Saying that a monarch who is faced with questions about the legitimacy of his reign was able to \"reciprocate\" his right to the French throne would mean that he either returned his right to the throne or that he responded in kind to the challenge. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text focuses on people who did reign as French monarchs and defended their right to do so",

Choice A is incorrect. The passage tells us that examining an item's age is the best way to predict how much longer it will last. Therefore, according to Taleb's theory, an item's age should add more certainty about how much longer it will last. Choice C is incorrect. A \"motivation\" is \"a reason for doing.\" Items don't have feelings and motivations, so it wouldn't make sense to say that their age is a motivation for how much longer they will last. Choice D is incorrect. \"Criticism\" can mean \"describing faults or problems\" or \"an analysis of an artistic work.\" Neither of these definitions makes sense here.

    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it logically completes the text's discussion of imported goods and consumer prices. In this context, \"nullify\" most nearly means negate or undermine. The text indicates that importing goods to a country can reduce consumer prices in that country, then cautions that the costs of transporting goods within the country is also a factor. These transportation costs likely raise the prices that must be paid by people who live far from the ports of entry. Therefore, the intranational transportation costs could nullify the price advantages to consumers of importing goods. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, \"denigrate\" would most nearly mean disparage or deny the importance of. Since transportation costs would not be capable of denying the importance of price advantages, it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs denigrate the price advantages of importing goods. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"underestimate\" would most nearly mean predict a lower value for, or to undervalue, someone or something. Though transportation costs might be undervalued, they cannot themselves undervalue something else, so it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs underestimate the price advantages of importing goods. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"misconstrue\" would most nearly mean misunderstand. Since transport costs are not capable of understanding, it would not make sense to claim that intranational transportation costs misconstrue the price advantages of importing goods",

The text refers to how, regardless of the scale of the work, Garza uses her memories of Texas and details from California to create her art. If Garza is basing her work on her direct experiences, then they play a part in her artistic process. This context thus suggests that Garza's art is inspired by the experiences of her childhood in Texas and her current life in California. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make logical sense to indicate that Garza is \"complimented by\"—or praised by— something inanimate such as direct experience. Choice B is incorrect because describing Garza as \"uncertain about\"—or unsure or doubtful of—direct experience would suggest that she had misgivings about it. If Garza were unsure of her experiences, that would suggest that she couldn't recall them, and Garza wouldn't be able to represent direct experience in her art if she were uncertain of the memories or details. Choice C is incorrect because describing Garza as \"unbothered by\"— or uninterested in—her experience would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about Garza's artistic process.

The text states that the National Council generates laws, while the principal chief and cabinet officials are responsible for \"devising policies and administering services in accordance with\" those laws. This context suggests that the principal chief and cabinet officials implement the laws: they put the laws into effect by creating policies and administering services that accord with those laws.

    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of delivering biomolecules to plant cells. In this context, \"overcome\" means to succeed in dealing with an obstacle. The text suggests that although it's difficult to move biomolecules through plant cell walls, Landry and her colleagues have shown that carbon nanotubes may be useful, since they can cross cell walls. This context conveys that Landry and her colleagues think it's possible, using carbon nanotubes, to succeed in dealing with the obstacle of transmitting biomolecules to plant cells. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to say that Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to \"conceptualize,\" or form an idea of, the difficulty of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells. The text presents this difficulty as a known problem that Landry and her colleagues think they may have solved, not as a mysterious occurrence that they have yet to form ideas about. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests that Landry and her colleagues think it may be possible to successfully deal with the problem of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells, not that Landry and her colleagues think it may be possible to \"neglect,\" or simply to disregard and ignore the problem. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to say that Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to \"illustrate,\" or demonstrate, the difficulty of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells by using carbon nanotubes.

The text indicates that Jamie Okuma challenges the position held by critics because her work can be seen at an art museum and can be bought by the public from her online boutique. The text also presents the critics' view as being influenced by a perception that fine artists create works that are \"timeless\" and meant for exhibition, whereas fashion designers periodically produce new styles that are meant for purchase.

Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to say that critics contend that fine art and fashion rarely \"prevail,\" or prove to be triumphant or widespread. The text indicates that Okuma is an example of an artist who demonstrates that it's possible to make fine art that is also available to the public as fashion.

The text establishes that unlike what critics believe, Okuma creates works that are in art museums and available for the public to purchase, suggesting that critics believe fine art and fashion rarely overlap, not that they rarely succumb. Choice C is incorrect because saying that critics believe that fine art and fashion rarely \"diverge,\" or disagree or move in different directions, wouldn't make sense in context. The text presents Okuma's work as both fine art and fashion, thereby undermining what the critics assert.

The text isn't indicating that Mr. Ryder is carefully controlling time itself; such a thing isn't possible. Rather, the text conveys that after making up his mind to ask a woman to marry him, Mr. Ryder had to make another decision about his own actions by selecting a time to propose; it's Mr. Ryder's decision that is measured, not the time he eventually chooses",

    "question": "Nigerian American author Teju Cole's ______ his two passions—photography and the written word—culminates in his 2017 book, Blind Spot, which evocatively combines his original photographs from his travels with his poetic prose. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "a": "indifference to",
    "b": "enthusiasm for",
    "c": "concern about",
    "d": "surprise at",
    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Cole's book Blind Spot. In this context, \"enthusiasm for\" means excitement about. The text explains that Blind Spot consists of original photographs as well as poetic prose—two elements that correspond to Cole's passions, identified in the text, for photography and the written word. This context suggests that Cole's excitement about photography and writing led him to create a book that successfully combines the two mediums. Choice A is incorrect because describing Cole as feeling \"indifference to\" his two passions wouldn't make sense in context. If Cole is indifferent to his passions, that would mean he doesn't care about photography or writing—in which case they wouldn't be his passions at all. Choice C is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels \"concern about,\" or uneasiness about, his passions. The text's use of the word \"culminates\" indicates that Blind Spot represents a triumphant climax of Cole's passions, not a work that results from his sense of discomfort with photography and writing. Choice D is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels \"surprise at,\" or astonished by, his passions. The text indicates that Cole's feeling about his passions \"culminates\" in a book that \"evocatively\" combines photographs and writing, suggesting that Cole has a long-standing and skillful relationship to his passions, not that he is startled by them",

    "question": "The following text is from Claude McKay's 1922 poem \"Morning Joy.\" The speaker is looking out a window and observing a wold, or large area of land. At night the wide and level stretch of wold, Which at high noon had basked in quiet gold, Far as the eye could see was ghostly white; Dark was the night save for the snow's weird light. I drew the shades far down, crept into bed; Hearing the cold wind moaning overhead Through the sad pines, my soul, catching its pain, Went sorrowing with it across the plain. As used in the text, what does the word \"drew\" most nearly mean?",
    "a": "Pulled",
    "b": "Drained",
    "c": "Inspired",
    "d": "Sketched",
    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \"drew\" most nearly means pulled. In the text, the speaker stands at a window, looking out on a landscape at night. The speaker then \"drew the shades far down, crept into bed.\" That is, the speaker pulled down, or lowered, the shades until they were completely shut before going to sleep. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"drew\" can refer to draining or removing liquid, especially water, as when someone draws water from a well, in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night. Choice C is incorrect. In some contexts, \"drew\" can be used to describe how a person or thing inspires, or elicits, a response from someone, as when a performer draws applause from an audience. But in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night. Choice D is incorrect. Although \"drew\" has several meanings, including sketched, or illustrated with a pen or pencil, in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night",

    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the artistic styles that have influenced Cannon's work.

The text indicates that a tension exists among the styles that have influenced Cannon's work and goes on to describe how those styles differ: classic European portraiture favors realism, American pop art uses vivid colors, and intertribal flatstyle rejects the use of shading and perspective to achieve depth. This context suggests that the styles that have influenced Cannon's work are disparate. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that there is a tension among the influences on Cannon's artwork, so it wouldn't make sense to say that the influences are \"complementary,\" or that they complete one another or make up for one another's deficiencies. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to characterize Cannon's influences as \"unknown,\" or not familiar; it's clear that the influences are known because the text goes on to list them.

Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"gentle\" can mean sensitive, or caring about others' feelings, that isn't the meaning in this context; it doesn't make sense to say that Alice thinks the sound of the snow cares about anything. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is shapeless, or lacks a definite shape; she isn't indicating how anything looks or feels but, rather, is describing how \"nice\" and gentle the snow sounds. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is bland, or uninteresting; rather, she notices the sound and comments on how \"nice\" it is",

    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text's discussion of studies of altitude's effect on blood chemistry. In this context, \"paucity of\" means lack of. In describing the inspiration behind Al-Sweedan and Alhaj's research, the text uses the word \"though\" to suggest a contrasting relationship between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. This contrasting relationship and the text's use of the word \"many\" provide context suggesting that there are few, if any, examples of the second type of study, whereas there are numerous examples of the first type. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context for there to be a \"quarrel about,\" or open disagreement about, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. The text's use of the words \"though\" and \"many\" suggests a contrasting relationship in terms of amount between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. There's nothing in the text to suggest that the contrast between the two types of studies involves the extent to which researchers broadly agree or disagree about the contents of either type. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context for there to be a \"profusion of,\" or great abundance of, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. The text's use of the words \"though\" and \"many\" suggests a contrasting relationship in terms of amount between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. Rather than logically completing this contrast, \"profusion of\" would indicate that the two types of studies are similar in terms of amount, with many examples existing of both types.

    "a": "overreacts",

    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of ectomycorrhizae relationships. In this context, \"reciprocates\" means responds in kind or degree. The text indicates that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats is \"mutually beneficial\" and involves a \"symbiotic exchange\" in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. In other words, each organism provides the same kind of benefit it receives: the tree provides a nutrient (carbon) for the fungus and the fungus reciprocates by helping the tree to absorb more of another nutrient (nitrogen). Choice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a \"symbiotic exchange\" in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Nothing in the text suggests that the fungus \"overreacts,\" or responds too strongly, by allowing the tree to be better able to absorb a beneficial nutrient. Choice C is incorrect because \"retaliates\" means responds to a harmful action with a similarly harmful action. The text indicates that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats is \"mutually beneficial\" and involves a \"symbiotic exchange\" in which each organism helps the other, not that the relationship is one in which the organisms harm one another. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"deviates\" would mean departs from an established course or norm. The text explains that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a \"symbiotic exchange\" in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient.

    "b": "praise",
    "c": "popularize",
    "d": "isolate",
    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of carte de visite photos. To \"popularize\" a technology is to allow it to be used and appreciated widely. The text explains that unlike the photos produced by earlier forms of photographic technology, carte de visite photos were inexpensive and could easily be obtained by \"everyday people,\" who enjoyed exchanging the images. Therefore, carte de visite photos helped popularize photography. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that instead of weakening the emerging technology of photography, carte de visite photos allowed it to be more widely accessed and enjoyed by people. Choice B is incorrect. The text establishes that large numbers of people enjoyed using carte de visite photos, so it can be inferred that these photos caused photography to be praised, or celebrated. However, it wouldn't make sense to say that inanimate objects—in this case, photos—had praised photography; instead, carte de visite consumers themselves would have praised it.

The text explains that Whatley encouraged farms to allow customers on site to pick their own produce for a fee. He did so despite critics' concerns that the customers would never pay to do so. This context establishes that the critics' concerns didn't hinder Whatley's efforts to promote the practice. Choice A is incorrect. The text indicates that critics' skepticism of the idea that customers would pay to pick their own produce didn't have some effect on Whatley's promotion of the practice.

The text indicates that Lucy Salazar and her colleagues have determined the age of Machu Picchu and that the age differs from another estimate of the site's age, explaining that the site is about 20 years older than scholars thought in 1911 when they initially encountered Machu Picchu. In other words, Salazar and her team found that the site's age differs from the first estimate. Choice A is incorrect. The text's structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they first encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. It wouldn't make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was \"genuine,\" or actual and true, while the one by Salazar's team wasn't, since the text treats the finding by Salazar's team as true and as invalidating the earlier estimate (\"it is approximately 20 years older than scholars thought\").

The text states that according to historian Edward Gibbon, Marcus Aurelius, who was widely considered virtuous, had only a single character flaw: his mild temperament. The text suggests that because of this flaw, Marcus Aurelius had an overly permissive nature. This context, in turn, supports the idea that Marcus Aurelius treated the vices, or evils, of those around him with excessive leniency, indulging rather than punishing those vices. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that Marcus Aurelius was widely considered virtuous, it gives no indication that he was inclined to \"despise,\" or hate, others' vices. Rather, the text suggests that he showed undue tolerance for these vices because of his overly permissive nature—that is, his inclination to allow others to do as they wished.

This context suggests that the relationship between the fossilized bones of Little Foot and the bones of chimpanzees and gorillas is one of similarity—the Little Foot fossils are likely comparable to the modern ape bones. Choice A is incorrect because if the fossilized bones of Little Foot were \"surpassed by,\" or exceeded by or made inferior to, the bones of modern apes that are frequent climbers, it wouldn't suggest, as the text says, that Little Foot was adapted to moving around in trees. If anything, learning that Little Foot's clavicle and shoulder bones were surpassed by those of chimpanzees and gorillas would suggest that Little Foot was poorly adapted to climbing. Choice C is incorrect because if Little Foot's fossilized clavicle and shoulder bones were \"independent of,\" or not influenced by or affiliated with, the bones of modern apes that climb often, it wouldn't suggest, as the text says, that Little Foot was adapted to moving around in trees. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that Little Foot's fossilized bones date to 3.6 million years ago, so they couldn't have been \"obtained from,\" or acquired from, the bones of modern apes",

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "a": "multifaceted",
    "b": "realistic",
    "c": "rousing",
    "d": "subtle",
    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the play's effect on audiences. As used in this context, \"rousing\" means exciting or energizing. The text indicates that critics found the play to have \"the opposite effect\" on audiences of what the playwrights hoped for. The critics, the text says, thought the play was wearying rather than energizing to viewers. This context supports the idea that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be energizing, or rousing, to audiences. Choice A is incorrect because there's no information in the text suggesting that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be \"multifaceted,\" or be varied or have many aspects. The text indicates that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for. Multifaceted is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing. Choice B is incorrect because there's no information in the text suggesting that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be \"realistic,\" or lifelike or sensible. The text says that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for. Realistic is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing. Choice D is incorrect because there's no information in the text suggesting that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be subtle, or complex or understated. The text says that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for. Subtle is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing",

Nina couldn't stop looking at the sepia-toned photograph in an oak frame. Propped on the window ledge, it featured a portrait of Great-Great-Grandmother Rosita as a young woman. ©2021 by Darcie Little Badger As used in the text, what does the word \"featured\" most nearly mean?",
    "a": "Displayed",
    "b": "Questioned",
    "c": "Approved",
    "d": "Ignored",
    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \"featured\" most nearly means displayed. The text describes Nina's fascination with a framed photograph. It then goes on to describe what the photograph showed, or displayed, which is a portrait of Nina's great-great-grandmother Rosita as a young woman. Thus, the text indicates that the photograph displayed a portrait of Rosita. Choice B is incorrect because the text identifies the person shown in the photograph as Nina's great-great-grandmother; it gives no indication that the contents of the photograph were questioned, or asked about. Choice C is incorrect because approved means expressed a favorable opinion of, and there's nothing to suggest that the photograph of Nina's great-great- grandmother has received approval or been viewed favorably, only that Nina is unable to stop looking at it. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the photograph Nina is fascinated with ignored, or refused to take notice of, Nina's great-great-grandmother Rosita.

    "question": "Bicycle sharing systems allow users to rent a bicycle at one location within a city and return it to any other designated location in that city, which can cause serious problems of bicycle supply and user demand within the city's system. Tohru Ikeguchi uses open-source data and statistical modeling to identify when a high number of users making one-way trips is likely to leave some locations within the system ______ bicycles and other areas with insufficient supply. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "a": "susceptible to",
    "b": "contingent on",
    "c": "saturated with",
    "d": "depleted of",
    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Ikeguchi's model of bicycle supply. In this context, \"saturated with\" means thoroughly or completely supplied with. The text explains a problem encountered by some bicycle-sharing programs: users can return bicycles to different locations than where the users picked up the bicycles to start, which can result in a mismatch between bicycle supply (that is, where the bicycles are currently located) and user demand (that is, the locations where users are hoping to pick up bicycles). The text goes on to explain that Ikeguchi developed a way to identify when this mismatch is likely to occur. This context suggests that Ikeguchi's method will show when it is likely that some locations have an insufficient supply and other locations, by implicit contrast, are saturated with bicycles. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some locations are \"susceptible to,\" or sensitive to or easily influenced by, bicycles. The text describes the phenomenon of bicycles being redistributed away from locations where users want them, not anything about those locations being influenced by the bicycles. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes situations in which some locations have an insufficient supply of bicycles because the bicycles have been relocated elsewhere, which suggests that the other locations have many bicycles, not that the other locations are \"contingent on,\" or dependent on, the bicycles. Nothing in the text suggests that the locations themselves depend on the bicycles for anything. Choice D is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to say that some locations are \"depleted of,\" or empty of, bicycles while others have an insufficient supply. The text describes situations in which bicycles have been relocated such that there is a mismatch between bicycle supply and user demand—the bicycles are no longer at the locations where users want to pick them up. This means that some locations do not have enough bicycles, while other locations must have many bicycles, not be depleted of bicycles",

Choice B is incorrect. The text never suggests that Tinker-Smith's choice was determined. That would imply that Tinker- Smith initially faced some kind of obstacle or opposition, and nothing like that is mentioned in the passage. Choice C is incorrect. The text implies the opposite of this. \"Arbitrary\" means \"based on random choice or whim rather than reason.\" But the text does give us a good reason behind the choice to tell Osage stories through ballet: two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage. Choice D is incorrect. The text never suggests that Tinker-Smith's choice was \"unpredictable.\" Rather, the fact that two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage makes ballet especially appropriate for telling Osage stories",

    "a": "indecipherable",
    "b": "ornamental",
    "c": "obscure",
    "d": "intricate",
    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the Three Sisters intercropping system. As used in this context, \"intricate\" would mean made up of complexly related elements. The text indicates that in the Three Sisters system, maize, squash, and beans form a \"web of relations\" in which the crops interact in various ways. The text's description of these interactions—the bean vines growing on the maize stalks, the squash vines keeping weeds away, and the beans adding nutrients that the maize and squash use—provides context suggesting that this \"web of relations\" is intricate. Choice A is incorrect because describing the relationship among the crops in the Three Sisters system as \"indecipherable,\" or impossible to comprehend, would not make sense in context. Although the text presents the relationship as complex, the text's description of the role that each crop plays makes it clear that the relationship is well understood, not indecipherable. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the practical benefits that each plant in the Three Sisters system provides to other members of the system, showing that the relationship among the crops that make up the system is not \"ornamental,\" or mainly serving a decorative purpose. Choice C is incorrect because describing the relationship among the crops in the Three Sisters system as \"obscure,\" or unknown or poorly understood, would not make sense in context.

    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the cover art of Virginia Woolf's novels. In this context, \"partnership\" means collaboration or joint effort. The text states that Woolf's sister Vanessa Bell was a talented painter and that Bell worked with Woolf to provide the cover art for most of Woolf's novels. Thus, this context suggests that Woolf and Bell pursued a creative partnership in order to produce several of Woolf's novels. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Woolf or Bell were undergoing a \"rebellion,\" or revolt, against anything in particular. Instead, the text focuses on how they worked together in some aspects of the production of Woolf's novels. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that Woolf or Bell made a \"discovery,\" or encountered anything new for the first time as they worked together. The text suggests that Woolf had already written her novels and that Bell then assisted Woolf with the cover art for many of them. Choice D is incorrect because the text implies that Woolf and Bell had a positive relationship. According to the text, the sisters \"worked closely\" together to produce the cover art for many of Woolf's novels; the text doesn't mention whether while working together, Woolf and Bell had a \"disagreement,\" or conflict",

    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the art at the National Museum of the American Indian.

The text explains that the painters whose works are included in this museum's collection employ an array of artistic styles, both Native and non-Native, traditional and new. Given this high degree of stylistic diversity, it is a misconception that Native art is uniform, or homogenous. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't consider whether Native art is controversial, or causes disagreement or discussion; instead, the text discusses the stylistic diversity of the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that some of the artists whose work is represented in the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian blend various artistic traditions into highly individual styles of their own, this is not the primary focus of the text. Instead, the text is concerned with how Native art is often mistakenly perceived as uniform, when in fact it is stylistically diverse. Choice C is incorrect because the text never implies that people mistakenly conceive of Native art as theoretical, or concerned with philosophical or abstract issues; instead, the text's discussion of Native art is framed around this art's stylistic diversity versus the misconception of it as homogenous",

CECILY: It is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a very brief space of time. The absence of old friends one can endure with equanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable. As used in the text, what does the word \"endure\" most nearly mean?",
    "a": "Regret",
    "b": "Persist",
    "c": "Tolerate",
    "d": "Encourage",
    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, \"endure\" most nearly means tolerate. In the text, Cecily and Algernon discuss parting, or saying goodbye. Cecily remarks on the deep pain of saying goodbye to people whom one has only known briefly and then comments on the equanimity, or calm steadiness, one experiences when separated from old friends. The text sets up an ironic contrast: one can easily tolerate, or put up with, the absence of close friends, but even a very short separation from a new acquaintance is unbearable. Choice A is incorrect. Nothing in the text suggests that Cecily associates regret, or a feeling of sorrow, with the absence of old friends. Rather, the text sets up an ironic contrast between the feeling of calm steadiness one feels when separated from old friends and the unbearable pain of being separated from new acquaintances. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \"endure\" can mean persist, or proceed stubbornly, it doesn't have that meaning in this context because what is being endured is the absence of old friends. Whereas one can persist despite the absence of someone else, one can't persist the absence itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't convey that Cecily encourages, or urges, old friends to be absent. Although it may be that Cecily prefers new acquaintances to friends she has known for a long time, the text focuses on her feelings as a result of others' absences, not on her treatment of others",

As used in this context, \"synchronization\" means the act of things happening at the same time. The text indicates that the dodder and its host plant flower in unison and that this synchronization occurs because the dodder makes use of a protein produced by the host shortly before flowering. Choice B is incorrect because referring to \"hibernation,\" or the state of being dormant or inactive, wouldn't make sense in context.

In this context, \"an oddity\" is something that is odd or unusual. The text explains that the burst lasted for 200 seconds and that other bursts generated by neutron mergers have usually lasted fewer than 2 seconds. In other words, the duration of gamma ray burst GRB 230307A was unusual.

Choice B is incorrect. In this context, \"a reprieve\" would be either a temporary relief from something or a delay of a punishment, neither of which would make sense as something that the duration of a gamma ray burst could provide to the burst itself. Choice C is incorrect. Although it would make sense to refer to gamma ray burst GRB 230307A itself as \"an incident,\" or a thing that occurred, the missing word describes the duration of the burst, and it doesn't make much sense to describe a length of time as an incident.

    "question": "Physicist Joseph Weber performed ______ work in gravitational wave research in the 1960s and 1970s, conducting key experiments that scientists later used as the basis for their own investigations that led to the first verified detection of a gravitational wave in 2015. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "a": "foundational",
    "b": "supplementary",
    "c": "repetitive",
    "d": "ineffective",
    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of physicist Joseph Webster's research on gravitational waves. In this context \"foundational\" means the basis on which something else develops. The text indicates that Webster's experiments in the 1960s and 1970s were earlier than, and \"key\" to, the work of later scientists in the field; thus, Webster's work was foundational to the later scientists' experiments and the eventual detection of a gravitational wave in 2015. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not suggest that Webster's work was supplementary, or an additional element of an existing, larger project, but rather it was \"the basis for\" later experiments. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not assert that Webster's work was repetitive, or involved doing something the same way many times. Rather, the text indicates that Webster's work formed the basis for later investigations in the field of gravitational wave research. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not state that Webster's work was ineffective, or failed to produce the desired outcome. Rather, the text strongly implies that Webster's work was productive and extremely important to later work in the field of gravitational wave research",

Instead of using standard shapes and colors, she typically explored innovative forms and daring hues. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "a": "creative",
    "b": "bold",
    "c": "traditional",
    "d": "understandable",
    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Helen Liu Fong's architectural designs. In this context, \"traditional\" means conventional. The text states that rather than use \"standard shapes and colors,\" Fong pursued \"innovative\" and \"daring\" design choices in her work. Fong's style is depicted as inventive, so it therefore makes sense in this context that she avoided mainstream, traditional designs in her buildings. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Fong's work is innovative and experimental. Thus, Fong's design choices could reasonably be considered creative, or original. She likely would have pursued creative designs, not avoided them. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Fong used \"daring\" hues in her designs. Thus, Fong likely would have pursued bold, or brave and vivid design choices; she wouldn't have avoided them. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't address whether Fong's designs are understandable, or reasonable or expected. The text focuses on certain characteristics of Fong's designs, not on how people received or understood them",

However, some scholars have suggested that the ancient Mesopotamian poem Epic of Gilgamesh may have had a far greater impact on Banisadr's work.

    "a": "substantial",
    "b": "satisfying",
    "c": "unimportant",
    "d": "appropriate",
    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the sentence about the influences on Banisadr's work. In context, \"It is by no means\" followed by \"unimportant\" conveys how it is relevant to recognize Bosch's influence on Banisadr. The text points out that the artist himself cites Bosch as an inspiration, and then goes on to claim that The Epic of Gilgamesh has had a more significant influence than Bosch. Choice A is incorrect because \"substantial,\" which means weighty or meaningful, incorrectly suggests that it wouldn't be meaningful to acknowledge Bosch's influence on Banisadr. The phrase \"indeed, Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an inspiration\" doesn't support this suggestion. Choice B is incorrect because \"satisfying,\" which means pleasing, incorrectly suggests that it wouldn't be pleasing to acknowledge Bosch's influence on Banisadr. The phrase \"indeed, Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an inspiration\" doesn't support this suggestion. Choice D is incorrect because \"appropriate,\" which means suitable, incorrectly suggests that it wouldn't be proper to acknowledge Bosch's influence on Banisadr.

    "a": "theory",
    "b": "evidence",
    "c": "constant",
    "d": "experiment",
    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of a prediction about a kilonova. In this context, a \"theory\" is an explanation that is considered scientifically acceptable. The text states that astronomers predicted in the 1990s that a collision between a black hole and a neutron star or between two neutron stars could release a massive gamma ray burst called a kilonova, explaining that they determined this possibility based on their extensive work with existing data and simulations (\"calculations and models\"). In other words, the prediction was a theory—a well-supported explanation—that, as the text indicates, was later confirmed with observations in 2017. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017, and a prediction of an event isn't \"evidence,\" or proof, of that event's existence, even when the prediction is based on extensive study. Further, there would be no need for later confirmation of something that was already recognized as evidence. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, a \"constant\" is a situation or factor that doesn't change. The text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017, and there is no reason to describe the prediction as a constant because the text doesn't suggest that the prediction was completely unchanged over time—it addresses only the making of the prediction and its later confirmation. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017; although a prediction might be informed by an \"experiment,\" or a controlled test, a prediction is an idea rather than a test",

    "a": "examples of",
    "b": "concerns about",
    "c": "indications of",
    "d": "similarities with",
    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because in context, sharing \"similarities with\" means having some resemblance to. The text establishes a comparison between two groups of mammals, stating that although they aren't closely related, hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs play similar roles in their habitats, a circumstance that has resulted in the independent development of some of the same physical traits. This context supports the idea that hedgehog tenrecs resemble, or share basic similarities with, true hedgehogs in some respects. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that hedgehog tenrecs are \"examples of,\" or representative of, true hedgehogs. The text states that despite some shared physical traits, the two groups of mammals aren't closely related; therefore, hedgehog tenrecs can't be examples of true hedgehogs. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"concerns about\" would mean worries about or interests in. The text focuses on the various physical traits that hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs share. There's nothing in the text to suggest why hedgehog tenrecs would be worried about true hedgehogs, or why they would be interested in them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"indications of\" would mean evidence of. By listing a set of traits that hedgehog tenrecs share with true hedgehogs, the text establishes a comparison between the two groups of mammals, and saying that the traits shared within one group of mammals provide evidence of another group of mammals wouldn't be an effective way to establish the similarities between the two groups",

    "a": "defunct",
    "b": "arcane",
    "c": "ubiquitous",
    "d": "extraneous",
    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of artworks that were produced for exhibition on the internet. In this context, \"defunct\" means no longer existing or functioning. According to the text, many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible due to their reliance on certain software. As an example, the text cites Sinae Kim's Genesis, which relied on software that was discontinued in 2021. This context supports the idea that the software is defunct. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that viewing artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet requires the use of software. Artists generally want their works to be seen by many people, so it wouldn't make sense for creators of internet art to require the use of software that is \"arcane,\" or known or knowable to only a few people. Moreover, the text states that a prominent example of software used to view these artworks is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it's now defunct. Choice C is incorrect because \"ubiquitous\" would mean found everywhere, which wouldn't make sense in this context. The text indicates that the reason why many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible has to do with the software required for viewing them. According to the text, one example of such software is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it's now defunct. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the software used to view artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet is \"extraneous,\" or irrelevant. Instead, the text indicates that use of specific software is required to view certain artworks from this period and that the discontinuation of the software renders the works inaccessible",

    "b": "manifest in",
    "c": "scrutinized by",
    "d": "complicated by",
    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the Kelmscott Press's books. In this context, \"manifest in\" means evident or apparent from. The text states that the Kelmscott Press, which was cofounded by William Morris, produced its books using preindustrial methods. The text notes the similarity between those methods, which include the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation, and methods used in the creation of medieval manuscripts. This context suggests that Morris's repudiation of industrialization is apparent from, or manifest in, the methods and materials his company employed. Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that Morris's repudiation of industrialization is \"insensible to,\" or unaware of or lacking perception of, the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation in the production of the Kelmscott editions. Instead, the text suggests that the methods and materials used to produce the Kelmscott editions are evidence of Morris's repudiation of industrialization. Choice C is incorrect because it would not make sense to say that Morris's repudiation of industrialization was \"scrutinized by,\" or examined closely by, the Kelmscott editions' use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation. Although creating the Kelmscott editions may have involved examining the books closely, the text does not mention this aspect of Morris's work, and in any case, the action of using certain materials to create those editions cannot scrutinize Morris's attitude toward industrialization. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Morris's repudiation of industrialization is \"complicated by,\" or made more complex or difficult by, the Kelmscott Press's use of preindustrial methods and handcrafted elements to produce books.

As used in this context, \"prescribed\" would mean laid down as rules. The text indicates that the characters in the comedies often defy gender roles that are \"socially dictated\" (even if most characters do return to those roles eventually) and that scholars have been very interested in these acts of defiance.

As used in this context, describing an explanation as \"a straightforward\" one would mean that the explanation is direct and uncomplicated. The text asserts that since it should be \"nearly impossible\" for planets to form in binary star systems, it's \"not surprising\" that there isn't a straightforward explanation for the existence of planets in such systems; the fact that one potential approach involves \"complex\" factors offers further contextual support for this idea. Choice A is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to say that there isn't \"a discernible\" explanation—meaning an explanation capable of being perceived—for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text discusses just such an explanation offered by Roman Rafikov and Kedron Silsbee, which indicates that their explanation can be discerned. Choice C is incorrect because the text emphasizes how difficult it is to explain the existence of planets in binary star systems, suggesting that the situation isn't marked by the lack of \"an inconclusive\" explanation—an explanation that does not resolve the issue—but rather that if any explanations have been offered, they've likely been inconclusive ones. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a lack of \"an unbiased,\" or impartial and unprejudiced, explanation for the existence of planets in binary star systems.

    "d": "consensus",
    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of US forest land classifications. In this context, \"consensus\" means agreement. The text indicates that a percentage given in a US forest land report differs from other estimates and that this discrepancy isn't surprising, given that forest researchers regularly dispute one another's classifications of parts of US forest land as either mature or old growth. This context conveys that there is little agreement when it comes to these categories. Choice A is incorrect because the text states that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classifications of US forest land as either mature or old growth, which directly indicates that when it comes to these categories, there is much \"deliberation,\" or discussion and consideration, not little deliberation. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classifications of US forest land as either mature or old growth; this doesn't imply that there is little \"vigilance,\" or careful attention, among researchers when it comes to these categories but rather conveys that researchers do pay attention to forest land classifications and question one another's decisions. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classifications of US forest land as either mature or old growth; this doesn't imply that there is little \"interest,\" or concern, among researchers when it comes to these categories but rather conveys that researchers are concerned with forest land classifications and pay attention to one another's classifications",

The text explains that critics' responses to the installation involved praise for Tsang's creative transformation of a space into a dynamic exhibit with huge images and lots of sound. This context conveys that the critics found the piece particularly creative. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that critics praised the installation for being dynamic and including huge images and lots of sound, and it wouldn't make sense to describe such an exhibit as \"restrained,\" or limited and not extravagant or showy. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that critics found the installation \"inexplicable,\" or incapable of being explained or interpreted, since the critics were able to explain their praise for the installation's transformation of a space with huge images and lots of sound. Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on the idea that critics praised Tsang for creatively transforming a space into a dynamic exhibit, not that they found the installation \"mystifying,\" or bewildering and hard to understand.

In this case, the elkhorn coral is an anomaly because it can pass on somatic mutations, whereas most other animals can't. Choice A is incorrect. A \"hypothesis\" is \"a theory about something,\" but no theories are provided about elkhorn coral in this text, just facts. Choice B is incorrect. \"Affinity\" represents \"an inclination or liking toward something.\" As genetic mutations tend to occur without any conscious effort, you can't really have an inclination toward passing on somatic mutations. Choice D is incorrect. \"Corroboration\" means \"evidence to support or prove something.\" Because elkhorn coral do the opposite of what most animals do, they do not provide corroboration of the theory that somatic mutations can't be passed onto offspring. Rather, they show the opposite",

Choice A is incorrect. Pretending that there are three species of electric eel might be a fun game for marine biologists, but it wouldn't prove the existence of more than one species. Choice B is incorrect. Complaining won't prove anything about eels, so de Santana could not have proved wrong the idea of only one species of electric eel by complaining about it.

    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion about Kouchaki and colleagues' research into how workload affects productivity. In context, \"efficient\" means effective or well organized. The text indicates that, according to Kouchaki and colleagues' research, people who worked on hard tasks first were \"more skilled and productive\" than those who did easy tasks first. This context conveys the idea that despite their sense of accomplishment, the people who chose to do the easy tasks first were less efficient or productive than those who tackled hard tasks first.

Rather, the text suggests that people are less skillful or efficient if they tackle easy tasks before the hard ones. Choice C is incorrect because \"outgoing\" means openly friendly, which wouldn't make sense in this context.

The text explains that the same genes that enable certain nonhuman mammal species to hibernate during the winter by altering their bodily processes are also found in our species but have \"essentially no effect\" on humans' bodily processes. In other words, these genes don't function in humans. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, \"decisive\" means has the power to affect the outcome of something, but the text states that genes related to hibernation are instead inactive in humans—that is, the genes don't affect humans' bodily processes, although they are present in their bodies. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"lacking\" means missing, but the text states that the genes are present in humans, though inactive.

    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Arturo A. Schomburg's collection. In this context, the phrase \"depended on\" means relied on. The text explains that Schomburg, wanting to preserve \"books, art, and other materials\" created by peoples of African descent from around the world, built a large collection of these objects. The text also states that in order to obtain these items, Schomburg asked friends and colleagues who were traveling internationally to bring them back for him. This implies that he wouldn't have been able to create his collection without help. Thus, the context supports the idea that Schomburg relied on, or depended on, friends and colleagues to build his collection. Choice A is incorrect because \"admired\" means respected and approved of. Although it's reasonable to expect that Schomburg respected his friends and colleagues, the text doesn't discuss any such aspect of their relationships. The text focuses instead on what Schomburg asked his friends and colleagues to do to help build his collection. Choice B is incorrect because \"disagreed with\" means held an opposing belief, and nothing in the text suggests that Schomburg and his friends or colleagues held opposing views on any subject. In fact, the text strongly implies that Schomburg's friends and colleagues supported him in his goal of preserving objects of importance for Black history and culture by bringing him such objects from around the world.

    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the early British postal system. In this context, \"reforms\" most nearly means attempts at improving something. The text indicates that the pay-upon-delivery postage method led to fee avoidance on the part of recipients. It then says that action was taken to improve the postal system, giving examples such as the move to having the sender pay and affixing stamps to indicate payment had been received. These represent revisions to the system intended to improve its functioning; therefore, \"reforms\" most logically completes the text. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, \"investigations\" most nearly means attempts to understand something. And although it is plausible that an attempt to improve the postal system would involve investigations, nothing in the text provides a logical basis for understanding the example of changes like affixing stamps to letters as an investigation. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, \"expansions\" most nearly means additions to something. Although the text indicates that some new policies were adopted, nothing in the text suggests that the overall number of policies increased, which expansions would seem to entail. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"possessions\" most nearly means items of personal property or things that otherwise belong to, or are part of, something.

The text notes that the regional variety of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has its roots in the language of the Taínos and in the West African language of Yoruba. This context supports the idea that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced back to Yoruba. Choice B is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn't make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be \"surrendered,\" or handed over on demand, to the pronunciation in Yoruba. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish has been \"announced,\" or officially declared or proclaimed. According to the text, elements of the dialect have been inherited or borrowed from African languages, and the relationship between the pronunciation of certain vowels in the Puerto Rican dialect and in Yoruba is an example of this inheritance, suggesting that the pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced to Yoruba.

It therefore wouldn't make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be \"offered,\" or presented as a gift, to the pronunciation in Yoruba",

    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Nuttall's 1886 research paper. In this context, \"acknowledged\" means recognized as having a certain status. The text indicates that other researchers recognized Nuttall's work as groundbreaking because of its \"convincing demonstration\" related to the age of the ancient sculptures. In other words, the researchers recognized the groundbreaking status of Nuttall's work. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"ensured\" would mean to have guaranteed or made sure something was the case. The text states that other researchers gave Nuttall's work recognition after it was published, but there's no indication that they contributed to the work or had any involvement that would have allowed them to make sure the work would be groundbreaking. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that other researchers \"denied,\" or refused to admit or accept, that Nuttall's work was groundbreaking; on the contrary, it indicates that researchers praised the work, recognizing it as groundbreaking due to its \"convincing demonstration\" related to the age of the ancient sculptures. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that other researchers \"underestimated,\" or undervalued, Nuttall's work; on the contrary, it indicates that researchers praised the work, recognizing it as groundbreaking due to its \"convincing demonstration\" related to the age of the ancient sculptures",

    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of environmental management along the US and Mexican border. In this context, \"requires\" means needs in order to perform a task. The text indicates that because ecosystems span the border, actions taken by the government on one side of the border can affect the environment in the nation on the other side of the border, which makes international cooperation crucial. In other words, because actions on one side of the US and Mexican border can affect the other side of the border, managing environmental matters along the border requires coordination between the two governments. Choice B is incorrect because \"praises\" in this context would mean to express a favorable judgment, but the text doesn't describe approval expressed by anyone, and it wouldn't make sense to say that environmental management itself praises intergovernmental coordination. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"reports\" would mean gives an account. Although coordination between the US and Mexican governments likely would involve some sort of reporting, the text doesn't describe any such practice. Choice D is incorrect.

    "a": "anticipate",
    "b": "inspect",
    "c": "reveal",
    "d": "justify",
    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the helmets found in Denmark. In this context, \"justify\" means confirm or give reasons for. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical about the supposed Viking origin of two helmets found in Denmark. The radiocarbon dating of the helmets conducted by Vandkilde and colleagues demonstrates that the helmets date from the Nordic Bronze Age, making the helmets too old to have belonged to Vikings. This context supports the idea that the scholars' skepticism is justified. Choice A is incorrect because \"anticipate\" means expect or come before, neither of which would make sense in context. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical of the idea that the helmets belonged to Vikings. Because the skepticism has existed for a long time, Vandkilde and colleagues' research couldn't be said to anticipate it. Instead, the radiocarbon dating results justify or confirm the scholar's skepticism. Choice B is incorrect because \"inspect\" means examine or review, which wouldn't make sense in this context. Research findings are inanimate and therefore unable to inspect scholars' skepticism. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues found that the helmets are from the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore much older than the Vikings. This context suggests that the researchers' findings justify, not inspect, the scholars' skepticism. Choice C is incorrect because \"reveal\" means uncover or report, which wouldn't make sense in context. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues tested the helmets and found that they date to the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore are much older than the Vikings. This context suggests that the researchers' findings confirm or justify the scholars' skepticism, which was already known so didn't need to be revealed",

    "question": "The following text is adapted from Zora Neale Hurston's 1921 short story \"John Redding Goes to Sea.\" John wants to travel far beyond the village where he lives near his mother, Matty. [John] had on several occasions attempted to reconcile his mother to the notion, but found it a difficult task. Matty always took refuge in self-pity and tears. Her son's desires were incomprehensible to her, that was all. As used in the text, what does the phrase \"reconcile his mother to\" most nearly mean?",
    "a": "Get his mother to accept",

    "c": "Get his mother to match",
    "d": "Get his mother to reunite with",
    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. The expression \"reconcile to\" means \"to cause (a person) to accept something difficult or disagreeable.\" The text suggests that John wants his mother to accept his desire to travel, even though she doesn't like that idea. Choice B is incorrect. This doesn't make sense. John doesn't want his mother to apologize for his own desire to travel—he wants her to accept his desire to travel. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn't suggest that John wants his mother to match his desire to travel. Rather, he wants her to accept his desire to travel even though she doesn't like it. Choice D is incorrect. This is tempting, because it seems to pick up on the idea of people \"reconciling\" after a fight, but it actually doesn't make sense. The text never suggests that John's mother was \"united with\" the idea of him traveling in the past—if anything, it seems like she's always been against it. Besides, it would be strange to say that a person \"reunites with\" a notion",

My soul had left its body to lose itself in the wild unrestrained beauty around me—from where it came—and only left a trembling suggestion of its existence within me. The other passengers moved around me like shadows, and again and again my eyes drank in all the glory and wealth of that night.

    "c": "Dispute",
    "d": "Command",
    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \"suggestion\" most nearly means trace. The text portrays the narrator standing on the deck of a boat, admiring the view of nature afforded by this position: \"My soul had left its body to lose itself in the wild unrestrained beauty around me,\" says the narrator, \"and only left a trembling suggestion of its existence within me.\" This intense response to beauty is such that the narrator's soul seems to disengage from its body, leaving behind only a barely detectible indication of its presence there. In other words, the narrator senses only a trace of soul left in the body. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \"suggestion\" can refer to an implied or indirectly expressed opinion, the text doesn't portray the narrator expressing an opinion; instead, the narrator is explaining an experience of intense emotion. Choice C is incorrect. While \"suggestion\" might be used in some contexts to refer to the tactful expression of a differing viewpoint, it doesn't refer to the dispute or difference of opinion itself. Moreover, the text doesn't portray a dispute between characters with differing viewpoints. Choice D is incorrect.

    "a": "forgetting",
    "b": "rejection",
    "c": "imitation",
    "d": "opinion",
    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of novelist Leon Forrest's admiration of William Faulkner's writing style. In this context, \"imitation\" means something that resembles or reproduces something else. The text states that Forrest admired Faulkner's style and that anyone familiar with Faulkner's style would be able to see the stylistic similarities between a particular passage in Forrest's novel Divine Days and Faulkner's writing, a fact that supports the idea that Forrest's novel pays tribute to Faulkner by reproducing, or imitating, Faulkner's style. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, a \"forgetting\" would mean an instance in which something is overlooked or not remembered. The text emphasizes Forrest's admiration for Faulkner's style and the fact that Forrest's writing in some instances closely resembles Faulkner's stylistically. It therefore wouldn't make sense to say that in trying to pay tribute to Faulkner's style, Forrest failed to remember it. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, a \"rejection\" would mean a dismissal of something as unworthy. The text emphasizes Forrest's admiration for Faulkner's writing style, stating that parts of Forrest's writings indicate efforts to copy that style. It wouldn't make sense therefore to suggest that Forrest had rejected or dismissed Faulkner's style as unworthy. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, an \"opinion\" would mean a view or judgment. Although the text focuses on Forrest's admiration of Faulkner, which suggests that Forrest had formed a positive judgment of Faulkner's style, the word opinion wouldn't make sense in this sentence: the sentence doesn't say that the passage from Forrest's novel expresses his view of Faulkner's style; rather, it suggests that stylistically, the passage closely resembles, or imitates, Faulkner's writing",

    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the fossilized bones of the hominin known as Little Foot.

The text indicates that the relationship between the fossilized clavicle and shoulder bones of Little Foot and the clavicle and shoulder bones of \"frequent climbers,\" such as chimpanzees and gorillas, suggests that Little Foot had adapted to moving around in trees. This context suggests that the relationship between the fossilized bones of Little Foot and the bones of chimpanzees and gorillas is one of similarity—the Little Foot fossils are likely comparable to the modern ape bones. Choice A is incorrect because if the fossilized bones of Little Foot were \"surpassed by,\" or exceeded by or made inferior to, the bones of modern apes that are frequent climbers, it wouldn't suggest, as the text says, that Little Foot was adapted to moving around in trees. If anything, learning that Little Foot's clavicle and shoulder bones were surpassed by those of chimpanzees and gorillas would suggest that Little Foot was poorly adapted to climbing.

Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that Little Foot's fossilized bones date to 3.6 million years ago, so they couldn't have been \"obtained from,\" or acquired from, the bones of modern apes",

    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the play's effect on audiences. As used in this context, \"rousing\" means exciting or energizing. The text indicates that critics found the play to have \"the opposite effect\" on audiences of what the playwrights hoped for. The critics, the text says, thought the play was wearying rather than energizing to viewers. This context supports the idea that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be energizing, or rousing, to audiences. Choice A is incorrect because there's no information in the text suggesting that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be \"multifaceted,\" or be varied or have many aspects. The text indicates that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for. Multifaceted is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing.

    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Ikeguchi's model of bicycle supply. In this context, \"saturated with\" means thoroughly or completely supplied with. The text explains a problem encountered by some bicycle-sharing programs: users can return bicycles to different locations than where the users picked up the bicycles to start, which can result in a mismatch between bicycle supply (that is, where the bicycles are currently located) and user demand (that is, the locations where users are hoping to pick up bicycles). The text goes on to explain that Ikeguchi developed a way to identify when this mismatch is likely to occur. This context suggests that Ikeguchi's method will show when it is likely that some locations have an insufficient supply and other locations, by implicit contrast, are saturated with bicycles. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some locations are \"susceptible to,\" or sensitive to or easily influenced by, bicycles. The text describes the phenomenon of bicycles being redistributed away from locations where users want them, not anything about those locations being influenced by the bicycles. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes situations in which some locations have an insufficient supply of bicycles because the bicycles have been relocated elsewhere, which suggests that the other locations have many bicycles, not that the other locations are \"contingent on,\" or dependent on, the bicycles. Nothing in the text suggests that the locations themselves depend on the bicycles for anything. Choice D is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to say that some locations are \"depleted of,\" or empty of, bicycles while others have an insufficient supply. The text describes situations in which bicycles have been relocated such that there is a mismatch between bicycle supply and user demand—the bicycles are no longer at the locations where users want to pick them up. This means that some locations do not have enough bicycles, while other locations must have many bicycles, not be depleted of bicycles",

The text indicates that in the Three Sisters system, maize, squash, and beans form a \"web of relations\" in which the crops interact in various ways. The text's description of these interactions—the bean vines growing on the maize stalks, the squash vines keeping weeds away, and the beans adding nutrients that the maize and squash use—provides context suggesting that this \"web of relations\" is intricate.

    "question": "The following text is adapted from Oscar Wilde's 1895 play The Importance of Being Earnest. CECILY: Have we got to part? ALGERNON: I am afraid so. It's a very painful parting. CECILY: It is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a very brief space of time. The absence of old friends one can endure with equanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable. As used in the text, what does the word \"endure\" most nearly mean?",
    "a": "Regret",
    "b": "Persist",
    "c": "Tolerate",
    "d": "Encourage",
    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, \"endure\" most nearly means tolerate. In the text, Cecily and Algernon discuss parting, or saying goodbye. Cecily remarks on the deep pain of saying goodbye to people whom one has only known briefly and then comments on the equanimity, or calm steadiness, one experiences when separated from old friends. The text sets up an ironic contrast: one can easily tolerate, or put up with, the absence of close friends, but even a very short separation from a new acquaintance is unbearable. Choice A is incorrect. Nothing in the text suggests that Cecily associates regret, or a feeling of sorrow, with the absence of old friends. Rather, the text sets up an ironic contrast between the feeling of calm steadiness one feels when separated from old friends and the unbearable pain of being separated from new acquaintances. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \"endure\" can mean persist, or proceed stubbornly, it doesn't have that meaning in this context because what is being endured is the absence of old friends. Whereas one can persist despite the absence of someone else, one can't persist the absence itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't convey that Cecily encourages, or urges, old friends to be absent. Although it may be that Cecily prefers new acquaintances to friends she has known for a long time, the text focuses on her feelings as a result of others' absences, not on her treatment of others",

The text presents something art scholars have noted and gives the example of people tending to find paintings with blues and greens more appealing than those with yellows and oranges. This context conveys that certain colors are more \"attractive to\" viewers than other colors are. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates only that people tend to find some colors more appealing than others and gives no indication that certain colors are ever \"confusing for,\" or puzzling to, viewers. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses the relative appeal of certain colors in paintings but gives no indication that any colors would ever be \"corrected by\" viewers, or somehow fixed or improved by them. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn't make much sense to say that some colors are more \"similar to\" viewers than others, which would suggest that colors and viewers are alike to different degrees. Further, the text primarily emphasizes a difference, not a similarity, in how appealing paintings tend to be based on the colors they contain",

    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft's contact with the asteroid 101955 Bennu. In this context, \"collected\" means acquired and took away. The text indicates that although the boulders on the asteroid's surface caused some unforeseen problems, OSIRIS-REx was able to gather a sample to return to Earth. This context suggests that OSIRIS-REx successfully collected a sample of 101955 Bennu. Choice A is incorrect because in this context \"attached\" means connected or affixed. The text indicates that OSIRIS-REx gathered pieces of 101955 Bennu to bring to Earth; it doesn't suggest that the spacecraft attached anything to the asteroid. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \"followed\" means tracked or traveled behind and the text discusses OSIRIS- REx's brief encounter with 101955 Bennu during which the spacecraft gathered a sample to bring to Earth. The text doesn't suggest that the spacecraft tracked the sample, and it's not clear what it would mean for the spacecraft to travel behind the sample it collected.

    "a": "synchronization",
    "b": "hibernation",
    "c": "prediction",
    "d": "moderation",
    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of a relationship between the dodder plant and its host plant. As used in this context, \"synchronization\" means the act of things happening at the same time. The text indicates that the dodder and its host plant flower in unison and that this synchronization occurs because the dodder makes use of a protein produced by the host shortly before flowering. Choice B is incorrect because referring to \"hibernation,\" or the state of being dormant or inactive, wouldn't make sense in context. The text focuses on something the dodder plant actively engages in—making use of a protein and producing flowers. Choice C is incorrect because stating that the dodder plant and its host engage together in \"prediction,\" or the act of declaring or indicating something in advance, wouldn't make sense in context. Rather than indicating that the dodder plant and its host plant make a prediction about flowering activity, the text suggests that the host produces a protein as part of its regular flowering process and that the dodder then absorbs and uses that protein to flower at the same time. Choice D is incorrect because referring to \"moderation,\" or the act of causing something to become less intense or extreme, wouldn't make sense in context. Although the text states that the dodder plant absorbs and uses a protein made by its host plant, it doesn't suggest that the dodder lessens the host plant's flowering activity; the two plants simply flower in unison",

Mrs. Wilkins and her friend Rose are traveling in Italy. \"I'm going to have one of these gorgeous oranges,\" said Mrs. Wilkins, staying where she was and reaching across to a black bowl piled with them. \"Rose, how can you resist them. Look—have this one. Do have this beauty—\" And she held out a big one. As used in the text, what does the phrase \"reaching across to\" most nearly mean?",
    "a": "Joining with",
    "b": "Gaining on",
    "c": "Stretching toward",
    "d": "Arriving at",
    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text \"reaching across to\" most nearly means stretching toward. The text begins with Mrs. Wilkins stating that she wants to have one of the oranges that she's admiring. The text then indicates that Mrs. Wilkins, staying where she is, holds out a big orange to her friend. This context suggests that when the text describes Mrs. Wilkins as reaching across to the bowl of oranges, it means that she is stretching toward the bowl. Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is joining with, or becoming attached to, the bowl of oranges. Rather, the text indicates that she is stretching toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is gaining on, or overtaking in a competition or race, the bowl of oranges. The text suggests instead that the bowl is sitting still on a surface and that Mrs. Wilkins is extending her arm toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate that Mrs. Wilkins is arriving at the bowl of oranges. In fact, the text states that Mrs. Wilkins stays where she is when reaching across to the bowl, meaning that she remains at a distance from it",

Bursts caused by neutron mergers typically last fewer than 2 seconds. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "a": "a coincidence",
    "b": "a reprieve",
    "c": "an incident",
    "d": "an oddity",
    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the duration of gamma ray burst GRB 230307A. In this context, \"an oddity\" is something that is odd or unusual. The text explains that the burst lasted for 200 seconds and that other bursts generated by neutron mergers have usually lasted fewer than 2 seconds. In other words, the duration of gamma ray burst GRB 230307A was unusual. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a difference between the duration of gamma ray burst GRB 230307A and the typical duration of bursts caused by neutron mergers, not \"a coincidence,\" or a point of correspondence, between them; the text indicates that GRB 230307A lasted much longer than what is typical of other bursts. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, \"a reprieve\" would be either a temporary relief from something or a delay of a punishment, neither of which would make sense as something that the duration of a gamma ray burst could provide to the burst itself. Choice C is incorrect. Although it would make sense to refer to gamma ray burst GRB 230307A itself as \"an incident,\" or a thing that occurred, the missing word describes the duration of the burst, and it doesn't make much sense to describe a length of time as an incident. Further, the sentence emphasizes that the burst's duration was very unusual, not simply that the burst occurred",

    "a": "transformed",
    "b": "introduced",

    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the contributions of the Sumerian civilization. In this context, \"introduced\" means brought into practice or use. The text states that the first reference to a seven-day week appears in the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh. The text presents this information about the seven-day week as an example of a concept introduced by the Sumerian civilization that persists into present-day civilizations. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the Sumerian civilization \"transformed,\" or changed the nature of, concepts that persist into present-day civilizations. Instead, the text's presentation of a Sumerian literary work that contains the first description of the seven-day week is an example of the phenomenon described in the first half of the sentence, suggesting that the Sumerians invented many concepts that still persist. Choice C is incorrect because the information that a Sumerian literary work includes the first description of the seven-day week suggests that Sumerian civilization may have originated the seven-day week and other concepts that persist into present-day civilizations, not that it \"inherited\" the concepts, or received them from an ancestral figure or culture. Choice D is incorrect because the information that Sumerian civilization produced the first description of the seven-day week is presented as an example of the phenomenon described in the first half of the sentence, suggesting that Sumerian civilization originated this and other concepts that still persist, not that the Sumerians \"overlooked,\" or failed to notice or consider, such concepts",

In this context \"foundational\" means the basis on which something else develops. The text indicates that Webster's experiments in the 1960s and 1970s were earlier than, and \"key\" to, the work of later scientists in the field; thus, Webster's work was foundational to the later scientists' experiments and the eventual detection of a gravitational wave in 2015. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not suggest that Webster's work was supplementary, or an additional element of an existing, larger project, but rather it was \"the basis for\" later experiments. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not assert that Webster's work was repetitive, or involved doing something the same way many times. Rather, the text indicates that Webster's work formed the basis for later investigations in the field of gravitational wave research. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not state that Webster's work was ineffective, or failed to produce the desired outcome.

Fong's style is depicted as inventive, so it therefore makes sense in this context that she avoided mainstream, traditional designs in her buildings. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Fong's work is innovative and experimental. Thus, Fong's design choices could reasonably be considered creative, or original. She likely would have pursued creative designs, not avoided them. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Fong used \"daring\" hues in her designs. Thus, Fong likely would have pursued bold, or brave and vivid design choices; she wouldn't have avoided them. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't address whether Fong's designs are understandable, or reasonable or expected.

    "a": "substantial",

    "a": "theory",

    "d": "experiment",
    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of a prediction about a kilonova. In this context, a \"theory\" is an explanation that is considered scientifically acceptable. The text states that astronomers predicted in the 1990s that a collision between a black hole and a neutron star or between two neutron stars could release a massive gamma ray burst called a kilonova, explaining that they determined this possibility based on their extensive work with existing data and simulations (\"calculations and models\"). In other words, the prediction was a theory—a well-supported explanation—that, as the text indicates, was later confirmed with observations in 2017. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017, and a prediction of an event isn't \"evidence,\" or proof, of that event's existence, even when the prediction is based on extensive study. Further, there would be no need for later confirmation of something that was already recognized as evidence. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, a \"constant\" is a situation or factor that doesn't change. The text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017, and there is no reason to describe the prediction as a constant because the text doesn't suggest that the prediction was completely unchanged over time—it addresses only the making of the prediction and its later confirmation. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017; although a prediction might be informed by an \"experiment,\" or a controlled test, a prediction is an idea rather than a test",

The text establishes a comparison between two groups of mammals, stating that although they aren't closely related, hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs play similar roles in their habitats, a circumstance that has resulted in the independent development of some of the same physical traits. This context supports the idea that hedgehog tenrecs resemble, or share basic similarities with, true hedgehogs in some respects. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that hedgehog tenrecs are \"examples of,\" or representative of, true hedgehogs. The text states that despite some shared physical traits, the two groups of mammals aren't closely related; therefore, hedgehog tenrecs can't be examples of true hedgehogs. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"concerns about\" would mean worries about or interests in.

There's nothing in the text to suggest why hedgehog tenrecs would be worried about true hedgehogs, or why they would be interested in them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"indications of\" would mean evidence of.

    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of artworks that were produced for exhibition on the internet. In this context, \"defunct\" means no longer existing or functioning. According to the text, many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible due to their reliance on certain software. As an example, the text cites Sinae Kim's Genesis, which relied on software that was discontinued in 2021. This context supports the idea that the software is defunct. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that viewing artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet requires the use of software. Artists generally want their works to be seen by many people, so it wouldn't make sense for creators of internet art to require the use of software that is \"arcane,\" or known or knowable to only a few people. Moreover, the text states that a prominent example of software used to view these artworks is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it's now defunct.

The text indicates that the reason why many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible has to do with the software required for viewing them. According to the text, one example of such software is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it's now defunct.

The text notes the similarity between those methods, which include the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation, and methods used in the creation of medieval manuscripts. This context suggests that Morris's repudiation of industrialization is apparent from, or manifest in, the methods and materials his company employed. Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that Morris's repudiation of industrialization is \"insensible to,\" or unaware of or lacking perception of, the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation in the production of the Kelmscott editions. Instead, the text suggests that the methods and materials used to produce the Kelmscott editions are evidence of Morris's repudiation of industrialization.

This suggests that the paintings are displayed in a systematic, or organized, way. Choice B is incorrect. \"Ranked\" might mean either classified or placed in orderly rows. Neither of these meanings would necessarily imply that the names of the paintings are easy to see (even if the paintings are placed in rows, their labels might be obscured). Choice C is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to describe the paintings as \"scheduled,\" or planned to take place at a certain time. Choice D is incorrect because if the paintings were \"discussed,\" or talked about, this would have no bearing on whether the names of the paintings could be easily seen",

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "a": "interjected",
    "b": "committed",

    "d": "prescribed",
    "answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of gender roles in Shakespeare's comedies. As used in this context, \"prescribed\" would mean laid down as rules. The text indicates that the characters in the comedies often defy gender roles that are \"socially dictated\" (even if most characters do return to those roles eventually) and that scholars have been very interested in these acts of defiance. This context indicates that what the characters are rebelling against are standards of behavior prescribed by the society of the time. Choice A is incorrect because saying that expectations about gender were \"interjected,\" or suddenly inserted between other things, wouldn't make sense in context. There's no suggestion in the text that the issue of gender roles was inserted between other things or was an interruption in a larger discussion. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Shakespeare depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been \"socially dictated,\" not expectations that society has \"committed,\" or carried out, entrusted, or promised. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Shakespeare depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been \"socially dictated,\" not expectations that have been \"illustrated,\" or clarified with examples.

In this context, \"source\" means a place where something originates or is obtained. The text states that people would share news while socializing at the general store. This context supports the idea that the store served as a source of information in rural communities. Choice B is incorrect because \"rival\" would mean competitor or opponent. The text doesn't indicate that the general store was a rival of anything. Instead, the text describes the general store as a place that enabled the sharing of information within rural communities.

    "c": "appreciated",
    "d": "disregarded",
    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of traffic signals. As used in this context, \"featured\" means had as a characteristic or part. The text indicates that although US traffic signals have lights of three different colors (red, yellow, and green), this wasn't the case until the 1920s, when the three-light signal was first developed. Before then, the text suggests, traffic signals had fewer lights (as indicated by the word \"only\" in the second sentence). This context supports the idea that before the 1920s, traffic signals featured only red and green lights. Choice A is incorrect because \"avoided\" means kept away from someone or something or prevented something from occurring, neither of which would make sense in context. The text doesn't discuss keeping away from someone or something but instead focuses on what US traffic signals look like. The text states that they didn't have lights of three different colors until the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s.

The text focuses solely on the fact that US traffic signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. The text doesn't mention how this characteristic or traffic signals in general are perceived or what their value is. Moreover, the blank portion of the text describes \"traffic signals,\" which are lifeless objects and therefore unable to admire or increase the value of something.

    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's description of efforts to explain the existence of planets in binary star systems. As used in this context, describing an explanation as \"a straightforward\" one would mean that the explanation is direct and uncomplicated. The text asserts that since it should be \"nearly impossible\" for planets to form in binary star systems, it's \"not surprising\" that there isn't a straightforward explanation for the existence of planets in such systems; the fact that one potential approach involves \"complex\" factors offers further contextual support for this idea. Choice A is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to say that there isn't \"a discernible\" explanation—meaning an explanation capable of being perceived—for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text discusses just such an explanation offered by Roman Rafikov and Kedron Silsbee, which indicates that their explanation can be discerned. Choice C is incorrect because the text emphasizes how difficult it is to explain the existence of planets in binary star systems, suggesting that the situation isn't marked by the lack of \"an inconclusive\" explanation—an explanation that does not resolve the issue—but rather that if any explanations have been offered, they've likely been inconclusive ones. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a lack of \"an unbiased,\" or impartial and unprejudiced, explanation for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text indicates that it's difficult to explain the existence of planets in such systems and it describes one attempt to do so, but there is no evidence that explanations from Roman Rafikov and Kedron Silsbee or others are biased",

The text indicates that a percentage given in a US forest land report differs from other estimates and that this discrepancy isn't surprising, given that forest researchers regularly dispute one another's classifications of parts of US forest land as either mature or old growth. This context conveys that there is little agreement when it comes to these categories. Choice A is incorrect because the text states that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classifications of US forest land as either mature or old growth, which directly indicates that when it comes to these categories, there is much \"deliberation,\" or discussion and consideration, not little deliberation. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classifications of US forest land as either mature or old growth; this doesn't imply that there is little \"vigilance,\" or careful attention, among researchers when it comes to these categories but rather conveys that researchers do pay attention to forest land classifications and question one another's decisions.

In this context, the phrase \"depended on\" means relied on. The text explains that Schomburg, wanting to preserve \"books, art, and other materials\" created by peoples of African descent from around the world, built a large collection of these objects. The text also states that in order to obtain these items, Schomburg asked friends and colleagues who were traveling internationally to bring them back for him. This implies that he wouldn't have been able to create his collection without help. Thus, the context supports the idea that Schomburg relied on, or depended on, friends and colleagues to build his collection.

    "question": "Researcher Haesung Jung led a 2020 study showing that individual acts of kindness can ______ prosocial behavior across a larger group. Jung and her team found that bystanders who witness a helpful act become more likely to offer help to someone else, and in doing so, can inspire still others to act. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "a": "require",
    "b": "remember",
    "c": "foster",
    "d": "discourage",
    "answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Jung and her team's study of acts of kindness. In this context, \"foster\" means encourage or promote the development of. The text indicates that Jung and her team found that seeing a helpful (or prosocial) act makes a bystander more likely to help someone else, which can in turn inspire additional people to help others. That is, the team showed that single acts of kindness can foster additional prosocial acts across a group. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Jung and her team found that single acts of kindness \"require,\" or depend on or make obligatory, broader prosocial (or helpful) behavior across a group. There's no suggestion in the text that individual acts of kindness can only occur if other prosocial acts have already occurred, and the text indicates only that an act of kindness can inspire additional helpful acts, not that it necessarily will do so. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on a possible direct effect of individual acts of kindness, or single helpful actions, and it wouldn't make sense to suggest that actions can \"remember,\" or hold a memory of, something. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate that Jung and her team found that single acts of kindness can \"discourage,\" or hinder, prosocial (or helpful) behavior across a group. On the contrary, the text states that Jung and her team found that seeing a helpful act makes a bystander more likely to help someone else, which can in turn inspire even more people to help others",

    "question": "Handedness, a preferential use of either the right or left hand, typically is easy to observe in humans.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "a": "recognizable",
    "b": "intriguing",
    "c": "significant",
    "d": "useful",
    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion about handedness in animals. As used in this context, \"recognizable\" means apparent or identifiable. The text indicates that handedness is \"easy to observe in humans,\" but that animal-behavior researchers use special tasks to determine handedness in other animals. This context and the use of \"less\" before the blank indicate that compared with handedness in humans, handedness in other animals is less recognizable. Choice B is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less \"intriguing,\" or fascinating, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn't suggest that handedness is more fascinating in humans. Choice C is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less \"significant,\" or important or meaningful, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn't suggest that handedness is more significant in humans. Choice D is incorrect because \"useful,\" or functional or helpful, wouldn't make sense in context. The text focuses on the ease with which researchers can determine whether an animal or person is right- or left-handed, not on how useful handedness in nonhuman animals is compared with handedness in humans",

    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Jacob Lawrence's artistic process. In this context, \"observant\" means watchful and perceptive. The text emphasizes that the \"close attention\" Lawrence paid to \"all the details\" of his neighborhood allowed him to reflect subtle elements of \"the beauty and vitality of the Black experience\" in his artwork. This context indicates that being observant of his surroundings was an important part of Lawrence's work as an artist. Choice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Lawrence was \"skeptical,\" or had an attitude of doubt in general or about particular things, let alone that skepticism was important to him as an artist. Rather than indicating that he was skeptical, the text focuses on how Lawrence paid careful attention to everything around him and reflected his observations in his artwork. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Lawrence was \"critical,\" which in this context would mean inclined to criticize harshly or unfairly. Rather than indicating that Lawrence found fault in things, the text suggests that he paid careful attention to everything around him and that his artwork reflects this careful attention. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that Lawrence was \"confident,\" or self-assured. Rather than addressing how Lawrence felt about himself and how that feeling affected his artistic process, the text emphasizes the careful attention Lawrence paid to everything around him—attention that allowed him to capture subtle elements of a particular place and time in his artwork",

However, neuroscientist Kimberley Whitehead has found that these uncontrollable contractions may play an important role in helping infants regulate their breathing. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "a": "involuntarily",
    "b": "beneficially",
    "c": "strenuously",
    "d": "smoothly",
    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of diaphragm contractions and hiccups. In this context, \"involuntarily\" means done without any control, or by reflex. The text explains that when a person's diaphragm repeatedly contracts and results in hiccups (which may be beneficial for infants), those muscle contractions are \"uncontrollable.\" This context indicates that the diaphragm contractions occur without the person's control. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn't support the logical relationship established in the text's discussion of diaphragm contractions and hiccups. The text indicates that although specific causes for hiccups haven't been identified, it may be the case that the muscle contractions that occur have an important purpose in infants. It wouldn't make sense to say that even though the contractions occur \"beneficially,\" or with a good or helpful effect, they might play a positive role in infants' breathing regulation. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that the diaphragm contractions that result in hiccups are \"uncontrollable.\" Because those muscle contractions are described as happening automatically and without the person's control, it wouldn't make sense to describe them as occurring \"strenuously,\" or in a way that requires great effort or energy. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't describe the quality of the diaphragm contractions that result in hiccups beyond stating that they are \"uncontrollable.\" Nothing in the text indicates that those muscle contractions occur \"smoothly,\" or evenly and continuously",

    "a": "immune",
    "b": "sensitive",
    "c": "limited",
    "d": "receptive",
    "answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of wild rice. As used in this context, \"sensitive\" means vulnerable or easily affected. The text indicates that climate change is causing the lakes to get deeper, which consequently threatens the wild rice that grows in the area. The text goes on to state that deep water can cause young wild-rice plants to uproot from the bottom of the lake. This context supports the idea that the plants are sensitive to water depth during early stages of development. Choice A is incorrect because \"immune\" means protected or shielded, which wouldn't make sense in this context. The text explains that deep water can cause young wild-rice plants to become uprooted and destroyed, indicating that these plants are harmed by deep water, not protected from it. Choice C is incorrect because \"limited\" means confined or restrained, which wouldn't make sense in this context. The text explains that water depth can negatively affect young wild-rice plants but doesn't suggest that water depth limits or restrains the plants. Choice D is incorrect because \"receptive\" means open or tolerant, which wouldn't make sense in this context. The text doesn't indicate that the wild-rice plants are open to or tolerant of an increase in water depth but rather the opposite: an increase in water depth can harm young wild-rice plants",

On cloudless nights after a daytime rain, Saeed's father would sometimes bring out the telescope, and the family would sip green tea on their balcony, enjoying a breeze, and take turns to look up at objects whose light, often, had been emitted before any of these three viewers had been born—light from other centuries, only now reaching Earth. ©2017 by Mohsin Hamid As used in the text, what does the word \"reaching\" most nearly mean?",

Choice B is incorrect. \"Consulting with\" means \"seeking advice or information from someone.\" Light is not alive, so it can't consult with Earth. Choice C is incorrect. It's confusing to say that starlight is \"only now running to Earth,\" both because light doesn't literally \"run\" and because the text is describing the moment the light touches Earth, not the period of time when it's traveling to Earth. Choice D is incorrect. This might be tempting, as \"clinging to\" has a connotation of \"sticking to.\" It wouldn't make sense to say that the light was \"only now\" clinging to Earth",

    "answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the origins of the unique dialect of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico. In this context, \"traced\" means tracked back to. The text notes that the regional variety of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has its roots in the language of the Taínos and in the West African language of Yoruba. This context supports the idea that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced back to Yoruba. Choice B is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn't make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be \"surrendered,\" or handed over on demand, to the pronunciation in Yoruba. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish has been \"announced,\" or officially declared or proclaimed. According to the text, elements of the dialect have been inherited or borrowed from African languages, and the relationship between the pronunciation of certain vowels in the Puerto Rican dialect and in Yoruba is an example of this inheritance, suggesting that the pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced to Yoruba. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn't make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be \"offered,\" or presented as a gift, to the pronunciation in Yoruba",

    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Nuttall's 1886 research paper. In this context, \"acknowledged\" means recognized as having a certain status. The text indicates that other researchers recognized Nuttall's work as groundbreaking because of its \"convincing demonstration\" related to the age of the ancient sculptures. In other words, the researchers recognized the groundbreaking status of Nuttall's work. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"ensured\" would mean to have guaranteed or made sure something was the case. The text states that other researchers gave Nuttall's work recognition after it was published, but there's no indication that they contributed to the work or had any involvement that would have allowed them to make sure the work would be groundbreaking. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that other researchers \"denied,\" or refused to admit or accept, that Nuttall's work was groundbreaking; on the contrary, it indicates that researchers praised the work, recognizing it as groundbreaking due to its \"convincing demonstration\" related to the age of the ancient sculptures.

    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the helmets found in Denmark. In this context, \"justify\" means confirm or give reasons for. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical about the supposed Viking origin of two helmets found in Denmark. The radiocarbon dating of the helmets conducted by Vandkilde and colleagues demonstrates that the helmets date from the Nordic Bronze Age, making the helmets too old to have belonged to Vikings. This context supports the idea that the scholars' skepticism is justified. Choice A is incorrect because \"anticipate\" means expect or come before, neither of which would make sense in context. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical of the idea that the helmets belonged to Vikings. Because the skepticism has existed for a long time, Vandkilde and colleagues' research couldn't be said to anticipate it. Instead, the radiocarbon dating results justify or confirm the scholar's skepticism. Choice B is incorrect because \"inspect\" means examine or review, which wouldn't make sense in this context. Research findings are inanimate and therefore unable to inspect scholars' skepticism. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues found that the helmets are from the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore much older than the Vikings. This context suggests that the researchers' findings justify, not inspect, the scholars' skepticism. Choice C is incorrect because \"reveal\" means uncover or report, which wouldn't make sense in context. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues tested the helmets and found that they date to the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore are much older than the Vikings.
